## Phase 1: Citation Opportunity Research

**What AI systems cite:**
- Original research and statistics
- Expert definitions and explanations
- Comprehensive guides and frameworks
- Proprietary data and benchmarks
- Unique methodologies

**Research what's being cited in your space:**

```
Using Perplexity.ai:
1. Ask questions about your topic
2. Note which sources are cited
3. Identify content types that appear
4. Analyze what makes them citable

Using ChatGPT:
1. Ask informational questions
2. Request sources
3. See what gets mentioned
4. Note authority signals
```

**Citation patterns by content type:**

| Content Type | Citation Likelihood | Example |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|
| Original research/surveys | Very High | "According to [Brand]'s 2024 State of X Report..." |
| Industry benchmarks | High | "[Brand] found that the average X is Y..." |
| Frameworks/methodologies | High | "The [Brand] Method consists of..." |
| Comprehensive definitions | Medium-High | "[Brand] defines X as..." |
| Expert guides | Medium | "[Brand]'s guide recommends..." |
| Opinion pieces | Low | Rarely cited |

## Phase 2: Citation Magnet Types

### Type 1: Original Research & Surveys

**What to create:**
- Annual industry surveys
- Benchmark reports
- Trend analyses with data
- Case study compilations

**Example structure:**
```
[Year] State of [Industry/Topic] Report

Key Findings:
- Statistic 1 with specific number
- Statistic 2 with specific number
- Statistic 3 with specific number

Methodology:
- Sample size and composition
- Data collection method
- Time period

Full Data:
- Charts, graphs, tables
- Downloadable data
```

**Why it works:**
- AI systems need authoritative sources for numbers
- Journalists cite original research
- Builds backlinks naturally
- Establishes thought leadership

### Type 2: Definitive Definitions

**What to create:**
- Glossary entries for key terms
- "What is X?" pages
- Concept explanations

**Optimization for citations:**
```html
<h1>What is [Term]? Definition and Complete Guide</h1>

<div class="definition-box">
  <p><strong>[Term]</strong> is [clear, authoritative definition
  in 1-2 sentences that can be quoted directly].</p>
</div>

[Expanded explanation follows...]
```

**Why it works:**
- AI often quotes definitions verbatim
- Clear structure makes extraction easy
- Becomes the "default" definition over time

### Type 3: Proprietary Frameworks

**What to create:**
- Named methodologies
- Step-by-step processes
- Evaluation frameworks
- Scoring systems

**Example:**
```
The PROFITS Framework for Call Analysis

P - Pattern Recognition
R - Revenue Attribution
O - Objection Mapping
F - Follow-up Triggers
I - Insight Extraction
T - Template Creation
S - System Integration

[Detailed explanation of each step...]
```

**Why it works:**
- Unique, quotable concept
- Establishes intellectual property
- Easy to reference and cite
- Demonstrates expertise

### Type 4: Industry Benchmarks

**What to create:**
- Performance benchmarks
- Industry averages
- Comparison data
- Pricing surveys

**Example data points:**
- "The average coach charges $X per hour"
- "Y% of consultants use call recordings"
- "Top performers have Z client retention rate"

**Why it works:**
- Everyone needs benchmarks for context
- Creates ongoing citation opportunities
- Positions you as the authority on data

### Type 5: Comprehensive Guides

**What to create:**
- Ultimate guides (5,000+ words)
- Complete tutorials
- A-to-Z coverage of topics

**Citation-optimized structure:**
```
[Topic]: The Complete Guide ([Year])

Quick Answer: [1-2 sentence summary for AI extraction]

Table of Contents:
[Comprehensive coverage of all subtopics]

Key Takeaways:
- Bullet 1 (quotable)
- Bullet 2 (quotable)
- Bullet 3 (quotable)
```

## Phase 3: Content Optimization for AI Citation

**Make your content easy to cite:**

### 1. Clear, Extractable Statements
❌ "Some experts believe that maybe content length could potentially matter..."
✅ "Content over 2,000 words receives 3x more backlinks than shorter content."

### 2. Quotable Formatting
```html
<blockquote class="key-finding">
  "87% of B2B marketers use content marketing, but only 37%
  have a documented strategy." — [Brand] 2024 Survey
</blockquote>
```

### 3. Prominent Data Placement
- Key statistics in headers
- Data callout boxes
- Infographics with embed codes
- Summary tables at top

### 4. Clear Attribution Signals
- Include publish date
- Author credentials visible
- Methodology explained
- Data sources linked

### 5. Machine-Readable Structure
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "2024 State of X Report",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "Your Brand"
  },
  "datePublished": "2024-01-15",
  "about": {
    "@type": "Thing",
    "name": "Industry Topic"
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Distribution for Citation Building

**Where to promote citation magnets:**

| Channel | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Email to journalists | Pitch key findings with data |
| HARO/SourceBottle | Respond to relevant queries |
| LinkedIn | Share key statistics |
| Twitter/X | Thread with data highlights |
| Industry publications | Guest post with data |
| Podcast appearances | Mention statistics |

**Outreach template:**
```
Subject: New research: [Key finding]

[Year] [Report Name] with some interesting findings:

- [Stat 1]
- [Stat 2]
- [Stat 3]

Full report with methodology here: [Link]

Happy to provide additional data or commentary if useful for
any upcoming pieces.

## Phase 5: Citation Tracking

**Monitor where you're being cited:**

1. **Google Alerts**
   - Set up for brand name + key report names
   - Monitor for quote usage

2. **Backlink monitoring**
   - Check new backlinks in GSC
   - Use Ahrefs Webmaster Tools (free)

3. **AI platform testing**
   - Regularly ask Perplexity questions in your space
   - Check if ChatGPT mentions your research
   - Monitor Claude responses

4. **Social listening**
   - Search your statistics on Twitter
   - Monitor LinkedIn mentions

**Citation velocity goals:**

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Month 1 | Establish baseline |
| Month 3 | 10+ citations |
| Month 6 | 50+ citations |
| Year 1 | Recognized authority |

</process>
