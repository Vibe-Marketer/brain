# SEO Domination System

**A complete search visibility command center for SEO, AEO, and GEO.**

This system goes beyond what you saw in that video. Instead of scattered, one-off prompts, you get:
- **Systematic workflows** with clear inputs and outputs
- **Ready-to-use prompts** for browser automation
- **Professional templates** for deliverables
- **AI search optimization** (not just Google)

---

## Quick Start

### 1. For Immediate Use: Prompt Library

Open `PROMPT-LIBRARY.md` and copy-paste prompts directly into Claude/Cowork.

**Most popular prompts:**
- Keyword research with filters
- Competitor analysis
- On-page SEO audit
- AI visibility check

### 2. For Structured Projects: Use Workflows

Read `SKILL.md` for the full menu of options, then dive into specific workflows:

| I want to... | Use this workflow |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Analyze competitors | `workflows/competitor-deep-dive.md` |
| Find quick SEO wins | `workflows/quick-win-finder.md` |
| Audit a page | `workflows/on-page-audit.md` |
| Check AI visibility | `workflows/ai-visibility-audit.md` |
| Create content brief | `workflows/content-brief-generator.md` |

### 3. For Reports: Use Templates

After running a workflow, use the matching template for professional output:

| Workflow | Template |
|----------|----------|
| Competitor analysis | `templates/competitor-report.md` |
| AI visibility audit | `templates/ai-visibility-report.md` |
| Content planning | `templates/content-brief.md` |

## What's Different About This System

### The Video Showed:
- One-off prompts
- Manual copy-paste between tools
- Data collection without action plans
- Traditional SEO only

### This System Adds:
- **Chained workflows** that complete end-to-end
- **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)** - featured snippets, PAA, voice search
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization)** - ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude visibility
- **Prioritized deliverables** with effort/impact scores
- **Templates** for consistent, professional output

## SEO vs AEO vs GEO

| | SEO | AEO | GEO |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| **Target** | Google rankings | Featured snippets, PAA | AI responses |
| **Goal** | Rank #1 | Own position zero | Get cited by ChatGPT |
| **Metric** | Rankings/traffic | Snippet wins | Brand mentions in AI |

This system optimizes for all three because modern search isn't just Google anymore.

```
Start these tasks in parallel:
1. Competitor keyword analysis for [COMP1]
2. Competitor keyword analysis for [COMP2]
3. Competitor keyword analysis for [COMP3]
4. AI visibility check for my brand

Then compile results into competitor report
```

## Pro Tips

### Save Prompts You Use Often
Keep a document with your most-used prompts pre-filled with your domain, competitors, and keywords.

### Run Monthly Audits
- AI visibility test: Monthly
- Competitor analysis: Quarterly
- Quick win finder: Weekly
- Content gap analysis: Monthly

### Batch Similar Work
Instead of auditing pages one by one, create a prompt that audits 5-10 pages in sequence.

### Always Export Data
Ask Claude to save results as files or present as tables. Track metrics over time to show progress.
