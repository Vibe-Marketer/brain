## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The One-Click Promise

> Every feature should complete the user's job in the **fewest possible actions** - ideally a single click.

This philosophy supersedes technical elegance and implementation convenience. When in doubt, reduce user effort.

**Before building:** Ask "How many actions?" then "Can it be fewer?"

**During implementation:** Combine steps, eliminate unnecessary decisions, automate the obvious.

### KISS-UX Principle

**Keep It Simple for the User** (not just for the code)

- Complex code that creates simple UX = Right
- Simple code that creates complex UX = Wrong

> **Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. We choose hard.**
