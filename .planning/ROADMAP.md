# Roadmap: CallVault Launch Stabilization

**Created:** 2026-01-27
**Depth:** Comprehensive (9 phases)
**Coverage:** 58/58 requirements mapped ✓
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-31 (Roadmap restructure: removed Coach, deferred Team Content Segregation)

## Overview

Stabilize CallVault for public launch by fixing core chat reliability, enabling collaboration features, and wiring orphaned functionality. This roadmap prioritizes the core value (reliable conversation intelligence) before polishing demos and shipping differentiators.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Security Lockdown
**Goal:** All security vulnerabilities eliminated before touching core features

**Dependencies:** None (prerequisite for everything)

**Plans:** 6 plans in 3 waves

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Delete dangerous code & secure test endpoints (SEC-01, SEC-02, SEC-03)
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Replace PII logging & fix type safety bypasses (SEC-04, SEC-05)
- [x] 01-03-PLAN.md — CORS migration: Group B functions (14 functions, SEC-06 part 1)
- [x] 01-04-PLAN.md — CORS migration: Group C batch 1 (24 functions, SEC-06 part 2)
- [x] 01-05-PLAN.md — CORS migration: Group C batch 2 (23 functions, SEC-06 part 3)
- [x] 01-06-PLAN.md — Security audit & human verification

**Requirements:**
- SEC-01: Remove client-side exposed API keys
- SEC-02: Delete legacy unauthenticated edge functions
- SEC-03: Add admin auth check to test functions
- SEC-04: Remove sensitive logging (PII exposure in console.log)
- SEC-05: Fix type safety bypasses in exports
- SEC-06: Migrate Edge Functions from wildcard CORS to dynamic origin checking

**Success Criteria:**
1. No API keys visible in browser DevTools or source code
2. All edge functions require authentication (no unauthenticated endpoints exposed)
3. Test/debug endpoints only accessible to admin users
4. No console.log statements exposing PII (session data, auth tokens, message content)
5. Export functions use properly typed interfaces (no `any` casting)
6. All production Edge Functions use `getCorsHeaders()` with dynamic origin checking (no wildcard `*`)
7. Security audit passes with zero critical findings

---

### Phase 2: Chat Foundation
**Goal:** Chat works reliably every single time with proper streaming and tool orchestration

**Dependencies:** Phase 1 (security must be locked down first)

**Plans:** 12 plans (9 original + 3 gap closures)

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Proof-of-concept: streamText + tool on Deno Edge Function
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Fix silent store failures (STORE-01: toast.error on 16 methods)
- [x] 02-03-PLAN.md — Extract search pipeline to shared modules
- [x] 02-04-PLAN.md — Tool call three-state transparency UI (success/empty/error)
- [x] 02-05-PLAN.md — Define all 14 RAG tools with zod schemas + system prompt
- [x] 02-06-PLAN.md — Frontend /chat2 test path for parallel development
- [x] 02-07-PLAN.md — Inline citations with hover preview + bottom source list
- [x] 02-08-PLAN.md — Streaming error handling, retry UX, connection stability
- [x] 02-09-PLAN.md — Switchover: /chat → v2, legacy rename, final verification
- [x] 02-10-PLAN.md — **[GAP FIX]** Call detail panel instead of popup dialog
- [x] 02-11-PLAN.md — **[GAP FIX]** Fix model hallucinating recording IDs
- [x] 02-12-PLAN.md — **[GAP FIX]** Error toast notifications + throttled logging

**Requirements:**
- CHAT-05: Migrate to Vercel AI SDK + OpenRouter
- CHAT-03: Streaming doesn't error out mid-response
- CHAT-01: Chat works reliably with all 14 RAG tools firing consistently
- CHAT-02: Tool calls return results (no silent failures)
- CHAT-04: Citations work consistently
- STORE-01: Fix silent store failures (errors swallowed)

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can send chat message and receive complete streamed response without errors
2. All 14 RAG tools fire when relevant to query (verifiable in tool call logs)
3. Tool calls that find data return that data to the UI (no green checkmarks with empty results)
4. Citations appear inline in chat responses linking back to source transcripts
5. Chat connection stays stable for 10+ consecutive messages without reconnection
6. Store errors surface to user with actionable error messages (no silent null returns)

**UAT Gap Closures (02-10 through 02-12):**
- Gap 1: Call links open in popup instead of panel — fixed by 02-10
- Gap 2: No error toast on network failures — fixed by 02-12
