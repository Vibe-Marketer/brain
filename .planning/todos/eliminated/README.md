# Eliminated Todos

Triaged 2026-02-26 during v2.0 pivot. All 5 were v1-only concerns that don't apply to v2.

| Todo | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Collapsible sources section | v1 chat UI — RAG chat system removed in v2 |
| Fix get_available_metadata RPC | v1 chat tool — entire chat-stream tool system removed |
| Project hygiene audit | Superseded — v2 builds in new repo, brain/ stays as-is |
| Chat scalability improvements | v1 chat infra (Redis, re-ranking, AI SDK) — all removed in v2 |
| Spec canonization & PRD triage | v1 specs/PRDs — v2 has own requirements in REQUIREMENTS.md |
