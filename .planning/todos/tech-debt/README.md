# Tech Debt Backlog

This folder tracks deferred work migrated from legacy specs/PRDs during the GSD transition.

Rules:
- Keep items actionable and scoped.
- Link each item to legacy source files for traceability.
- Prefer merging overlapping legacy requests into one modern backlog item.
- Do not store active phase execution here; use `.planning/phases/` for active delivery.
