## Why this exists

Many small PRD items are duplicates or minor polish requests. They are merged here as one curated tech-debt stream.

## Backlog items

1. Navigation and sidebar polish pass (button placement, collapsed selected states, spacing consistency).
2. Integration UX hardening (multi-account handling, explicit cancel state, better error affordances).
3. Content hub UX polish (loading states, card visual consistency, naming conventions).
4. Settings/detail polish pass (business profile edit flow, icon visibility, divider cleanup, edit affordance placement).
5. Evaluate and either formalize or remove missing debug tool request.

## Notes

- Batch into one dedicated UI debt phase to avoid fragmented one-off changes.
- Apply brand guidelines and pane-first rules during implementation.
