## Why this exists

These are larger, still-relevant ideas that should be re-planned under the GSD process instead of implemented from legacy docs directly.

## Backlog epics

1. Sorting and tagging UX rework (evaluate against current Vault-first IA).
2. Profile creation/management flow redesign.
3. Knowledge base indexing visibility and health metrics.
4. Content/agent strategy consolidation, including PROFITS trigger alignment in content workflows.

## Notes

- Require fresh GSD research + planning before execution.
- Treat legacy docs as context only; do not execute legacy acceptance criteria verbatim.
