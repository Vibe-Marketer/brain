# TODO: UI Alignment Phase 2 (Pending)

Date: 2026-02-11
Status: Open

## Pending / Undecided Items

1. Complete app-wide Tier 2/3 polish sweep:
   - token normalization (remaining non-standard classes)
   - spacing and typography normalization
   - loading/empty/error state normalization
2. Finalize and publish pane-first design guideline replacement as canonical standard.
3. Run authenticated visual QA pass across major routes and capture screenshot-based signoff.
4. Consolidate remaining legacy variant paths that still diverge from selector/marker standards.

## Scope Guardrails

- Reuse existing page/pane components first.
- Avoid net-new layout primitives unless no equivalent exists.
- Keep changes incremental and route-safe.

## Exit Criteria

- No obvious selector/indicator style drift between sidebar and pane selectors.
- No high-visibility page-level fit/finish mismatches across major routes.
- Updated guideline is published and referenced as implementation source of truth.
