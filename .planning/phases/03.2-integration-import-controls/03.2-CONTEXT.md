# Phase 3.2: Integration Import Controls - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-28
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add a "Sources" filter control to the Sync page (alongside the existing date filter) that allows users to toggle which connected integrations are included when viewing meetings. This is a filter mechanism, not a section redesign.

## Implementation Decisions

### Filter control design
- Dropdown button matching the date filter pattern
- Button label shows "Sources" + count + small circular integration icons
- Icons match the size used in the transcripts table (small circular)
- Positioned alongside existing date filter in the filter bar

### Dropdown contents
- Only connected integrations appear in dropdown
- Each row: integration icon + name + toggle switch
- Dimmed row appearance when toggle is off
- At least one integration must remain enabled (prevent disabling last one)

### Toggle behavior
- Immediate client-side filtering (no refetch)
- Filter state persisted to database (restored on next visit)
- New integrations enabled by default when connected
- Filter scope is Sync page only (does NOT affect Chat search)

### Button states
- When integrations connected: Shows count + icons of enabled integrations only
- When all disabled: Prevented (last one cannot be disabled)
- When no integrations connected: Show disabled/grayed button

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact dropdown positioning and animation
- Spacing and typography within dropdown
- Transition effects when filtering meetings

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Button should feel like the existing date filter — consistent with current UI patterns
- Icons are same logos as Phase 3.1 integration buttons, but smaller (circular for filter, larger rounded square for connection buttons)
- Full row in dropdown: icon left, name middle, toggle right — clear and readable

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
