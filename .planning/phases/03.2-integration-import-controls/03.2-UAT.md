## Current Test

number: 1
name: Sources Filter Button Visibility
expected: |
  Go to the Sync page (http://localhost:8080/?tab=sync).
  If you have at least one integration connected (Fathom, Zoom, or Google Meet), you should see a "Sources" filter button in the filter bar alongside the date filter.
  If no integrations are connected, the Sources filter button should NOT appear.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Sources Filter Button Visibility
expected: Sources filter button appears in filter bar when integrations are connected, hidden when none connected
result: [pending]

### 2. Sources Filter Dropdown
expected: Clicking the Sources button opens a dropdown showing only your connected integrations with Switch toggles (on/off)
result: [pending]

### 3. Toggle Filtering
expected: Toggling an integration off immediately filters the meetings list - meetings from that source disappear without page refresh
result: [pending]

### 4. Prevent Disable All
expected: When trying to turn off the last enabled source, a toast error appears saying "At least one source must be enabled" and the toggle stays on
result: [pending]

### 5. Filter State Persistence
expected: After toggling a source off, refresh the page. The filter state should persist - the same sources should be enabled/disabled as before
result: [pending]

### 6. Visual Feedback
expected: The Sources filter button shows small icons of the currently enabled integrations, and rows in the dropdown appear dimmed when their toggle is off
result: [pending]
