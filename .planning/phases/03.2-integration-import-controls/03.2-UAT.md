## Current Test

number: 3
name: Toggle Filtering
expected: |
  Toggle an integration off in the dropdown. The meetings list should immediately update - meetings from that source should disappear without needing to refresh the page.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Sources Filter Button Visibility
expected: Sources filter button appears in filter bar when integrations are connected, hidden when none connected
result: pass

### 2. Sources Filter Dropdown
expected: Clicking the Sources button opens a dropdown showing only your connected integrations with Switch toggles (on/off)
result: pass

### 3. Toggle Filtering
expected: Toggling an integration off immediately filters the meetings list - meetings from that source disappear without page refresh
result: [pending]

### 4. Prevent Disable All
expected: When trying to turn off the last enabled source, a toast error appears saying "At least one source must be enabled" and the toggle stays on
result: [pending]

### 5. Filter State Persistence
expected: After toggling a source off, refresh the page. The filter state should persist - the same sources should be enabled/disabled as before
result: [pending]

### 6. Visual Feedback
expected: The Sources filter button shows small icons of the currently enabled integrations, and rows in the dropdown appear dimmed when their toggle is off
result: [pending]
