## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Sources Filter Button Visibility
expected: Sources filter button appears in filter bar when integrations are connected, hidden when none connected
result: pass

### 2. Sources Filter Dropdown
expected: Clicking the Sources button opens a dropdown showing only your connected integrations with Switch toggles (on/off)
result: pass

### 3. Toggle Filtering
expected: Toggling an integration off immediately filters the meetings list - meetings from that source disappear without page refresh
result: pass

### 4. Prevent Disable All
expected: When trying to turn off the last enabled source, a toast error appears saying "At least one source must be enabled" and the toggle stays on
result: pass

### 5. Filter State Persistence
expected: After toggling a source off, refresh the page. The filter state should persist - the same sources should be enabled/disabled as before
result: issue
reported: "fail"
severity: major

### 6. Visual Feedback
expected: The Sources filter button shows small icons of the currently enabled integrations, and rows in the dropdown appear dimmed when their toggle is off
result: skipped
reason: User redesigned UI - eliminated this feature

  root_cause: "connectedPlatforms array is created inline with .map() in SyncTab, creating new reference on every render. This causes useSyncSourceFilter's useEffect to re-run and reset enabledSources to connectedPlatforms on each render, overwriting the loaded filter preferences."
