## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. YouTube Vault Creation
expected: In the Vaults page, create a new vault. The vault type options should include "YouTube". Creating a YouTube vault should show a red YouTube icon and "YouTube" label in the vault list.
result: issue
reported: "I don't se this as an option in settings or in the hubs page.."
severity: major

### 2. YouTube Vault Video List Layout
expected: Open a YouTube vault that has imported videos. Instead of the standard TranscriptTable, you should see a media-row list with video thumbnails (small images), title, channel name, view/like counts, duration, and category columns. An "Outlier" column should show a dashed placeholder with "coming soon" tooltip.
result: issue
reported: "I don't have the ability to test any of this because whatever was done hasn't made it possible to import. I am still getting HTTP 400 on POST /functions/v1/youtube-import."
severity: blocker

### 3. Sortable Column Headers
expected: In the YouTube video list, click on column headers (Date, Views, Likes, Duration, Title). Each click should sort the list by that column, and an arrow indicator should show the current sort direction.
result: issue
reported: "YOU'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING ... NONE OF THIS SHIT EXISTS AT ALL YET BECAUSE I CAN'T IMPORT A FUCKING VIDEO!"
severity: blocker

### 4. Video Search
expected: In a YouTube vault, there should be a search bar. Type a keyword and the video list should filter to matching titles after a brief debounce (~300ms).
result: issue
reported: "I CANT TEST IF I DON'T HAVE A VIDEO TO IMPORT!"
severity: blocker

### 5. VaultSelector YouTube Filtering During Import
expected: Go to the YouTube import page (ManualImport). The vault selector should only show YouTube-type vaults. If no YouTube vault exists yet, it should show a message like "A YouTube Hub will be created automatically".
result: skipped
reason: blocked by import prerequisite failure (HTTP 400 on youtube-import)

### 6. YouTube Vault Auto-Creation on First Import
expected: Import a YouTube video when no YouTube vault exists. After the import completes, a "YouTube Vault" should be automatically created in your personal bank and the imported video should appear inside it.
result: skipped
reason: blocked by import prerequisite failure (HTTP 400 on youtube-import)

### 7. Video Detail Modal
expected: In a YouTube vault, click on any video row. A modal should open showing: video summary above the fold (thumbnail, title, channel, stats, duration, published date, category), a collapsible description (3-line clamp by default with show more/less toggle), and a scrollable transcript section.
result: skipped
reason: blocked by import prerequisite failure (HTTP 400 on youtube-import)

### 8. Start Chat from Video Detail
expected: In the video detail modal, there should be a "Start Chat" button. Clicking it should navigate to the /chat page with the YouTube vault context pre-applied, so chat is scoped to that video.
result: skipped
reason: blocked by import prerequisite failure (HTTP 400 on youtube-import)

### 9. Non-YouTube Vaults Unaffected
expected: Open a standard (non-YouTube) vault. It should still show the normal TranscriptTable with the regular recording list and VaultSearchFilter controls - no YouTube-specific UI should appear.
result: pass
