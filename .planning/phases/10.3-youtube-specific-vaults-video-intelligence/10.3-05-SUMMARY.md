# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 10.3-youtube-specific-vaults-video-intelligence
    provides: YouTube vault type support in schema, rendering, and import flows
provides:
  - YouTube is selectable in Hubs create dialog and Settings vault creation flow
  - Regression tests that guard youtube option visibility and create payload type
affects: [10.3-06-gap-closure, phase-11-profits-frontend-trigger]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Keep vault type option parity across all user-facing create surfaces
    - Cover option regressions with focused UI payload tests

key-files:
  created:
    - src/components/dialogs/__tests__/CreateVaultDialog.test.tsx
    - src/components/settings/__tests__/VaultManagement.test.tsx
  modified:
    - src/components/dialogs/CreateVaultDialog.tsx
    - src/components/settings/VaultManagement.tsx

key-decisions:
  - Keep existing disabled hub types unchanged while enabling YouTube explicitly in both create flows

patterns-established:
  - "Create flow parity: new vault types must be exposed in Hubs and Settings entry points together"
  - "Regression tests assert both UI availability and submitted vault type payload"

# Phase 10.3 Plan 05: YouTube Create Option Gap Closure Summary

**Enabled first-class YouTube hub creation from both Hubs and Settings surfaces with regression protection on option visibility and payload type.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-11T06:27:25Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-11T06:30:35Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Added an enabled `youtube` option to `CreateVaultDialog` vault type choices.
- Added an enabled `YouTube` option to Settings `VaultManagement` create selector.
- Added focused Vitest regressions for YouTube option exposure and create payload type from both surfaces.

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add YouTube create option to both vault creation surfaces** - `dacfc58` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Add regression tests for create-option availability** - `e84146f` (test)

**Plan metadata:** `[pending]` (docs: complete plan)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/dialogs/CreateVaultDialog.tsx` - Added enabled YouTube vault type option.
- `src/components/settings/VaultManagement.tsx` - Added enabled YouTube select item in settings create flow.
- `src/components/dialogs/__tests__/CreateVaultDialog.test.tsx` - Added tests for YouTube option visibility and submit payload.
- `src/components/settings/__tests__/VaultManagement.test.tsx` - Added tests for YouTube option visibility and submit payload.

## Decisions Made
- Enabled YouTube with label `YouTube` in both create entry points while leaving other intentionally disabled options untouched.

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Ready for the remaining phase 10.3 gap closure plan(s).
- No blockers identified.
