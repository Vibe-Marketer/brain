# Phase 10.3: YouTube-Specific Vaults & Video Intelligence - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Deliver a dedicated YouTube vault experience within existing Vault infrastructure: separate YouTube vault type, YouTube-specific video list UX, metadata-rich browsing, and transcript chat parity using existing chat/vault systems.

This phase clarifies how YouTube vaults behave and look. It does not add unrelated new capabilities.

## Implementation Decisions

### List layout and density
- Desktop list uses a media-row style (YouTube Studio-like), not card row or compact transcript-style table.
- Thumbnail size is medium (`120x68`) for balance between scanability and density.
- Show a one-line description snippet in each row.
- Always-visible metadata in list rows: views/likes/comments, channel + subscriber count, duration + published time, category, and outlier rank column.

### Ranking and sorting behavior
- Default sort should prioritize outlier ranking behavior first.
- Outlier Rank column is visible now but in pre-launch state as a disabled placeholder slot (not hidden).
- Outlier Rank sort interaction can appear as placeholder behavior for now (non-final ranking logic).
- Tie-breaker for active sortable metrics should be published date (newer wins).

### Detail view experience
- Clicking title/thumbnail opens a modal overlay for video details.
- Above-the-fold detail content prioritizes video summary first (thumbnail/title/channel/stats), then transcript/content.
- Description defaults to collapsed (3 lines) with expand/collapse.
- AI chat must reuse existing call/transcript chat infrastructure and existing vault infra; no overlapping parallel chat system.
- Chat entry should be user-triggered via click-to-start pattern (not auto-start).

### Vault flow and guardrails
- If no YouTube vault exists, auto-create one at first import attempt.
- Default auto-created vault name: `YouTube Vault`.
- Import selector should prevent non-YouTube vault selection (guardrail in selector, not post-submit error).
- Vaults page should auto-switch view/layout based on selected vault type.
- For now, no dedicated `All | Calls | YouTube` type filter control; treat YouTube vault as "just another vault" in existing switching flow.

### OpenCode's Discretion
- Exact responsive/mobile behavior while preserving selected desktop hierarchy.
- Exact visual treatment of disabled outlier placeholders (so long as clearly non-active).
- Exact modal micro-interactions and transitions, while reusing existing component patterns.

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Keep look and feel consistent with existing Vault UX: easy vault switching, no fragmented separate mini-app.
- Reuse existing infrastructure wherever possible (chat, vault plumbing, existing component patterns).
- Do not build overlapping components when existing ones can be extended.
- Outlier ranking should be visually prominent in the list even before activation (as a coming-soon placeholder state).

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- Dedicated sidebar section/nav for "Videos" is deferred to a future phase (current phase stays inside existing Vaults structure).
- Fully active outlier ranking algorithm/feature behavior beyond placeholder UI is deferred to a follow-on phase.
