## What CallVault Is

CallVault is the organized call workspace that captures, organizes, and exposes your sales calls to whatever AI you already use. Import from Fathom or Zoom. Organize into Workspaces and Folders. Connect to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and others via MCP. Your calls, structured and ready — for your AI, your team, and your memory.

---

## Who It's For

**Primary buyer: Heads of Sales and RevOps at B2B companies with 5–50 reps.**

Qualifying signals — they:
- Use Fathom or Zoom for call recording
- Have 50+ calls per month across the team
- Want AI analysis but not Gong's price tag or AI lock-in
- Need to share call context across reps and managers
- Are asking "how do we get more out of the calls we're already doing?"

**Secondary / tactical: Coaches and consultants.** Early adopters, testimonial sources, and referral channels into sales teams. They are not the strategic buyer.

---

## What We Are NOT

These are not qualifiers. They are hard stops.

1. **Not a recorder or transcription tool.** Calls are imported from Fathom, Zoom, and YouTube — tools you already use. CallVault does not record calls.
2. **Not an AI assistant or coach.** CallVault does not replace Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini. It connects you to them.
3. **Not an analytics or intelligence platform.** No pipeline forecasting. No scorecards. No coaching dashboards. That is Gong's job.
4. **Not a CRM or system-of-record for deals.** CallVault is the call layer, not the account database. It works alongside your CRM.
5. **Not "AI-powered everything."** CallVault is AI-ready, not AI-powered. We organize the calls. You choose the AI.

## What Makes Us Different

- **AI-agnostic.** Works with whatever AI you already use — Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, and more — via MCP. No new AI to learn. No lock-in.
- **Workspace-first organization.** Organization > Workspace > Folder hierarchy with permissions, sharing, and import routing rules. Calls arrive pre-organized via Smart Import.
- **A fraction of the cost of conversation intelligence platforms.** Gong costs more per rep per month than CallVault costs per team per year. Different category, different price band.

---

## Who It's NOT For

- Individual consumers recording personal calls
- Companies wanting a full conversation intelligence platform (scorecards, pipeline forecasting, coaching dashboards)
- Teams looking for a CRM or deal management system
- Anyone who wants us to BE their AI

## The One-Liner

**"Close more deals from the calls you're already having."**

---

## Messaging Hierarchy

| Layer | Line |
|-------|------|
| Hook (benefit) | "Close more deals from the calls you're already having." |
| Category (positioning) | "The operating system for your sales calls." |
| Mechanism (how) | Captures, organizes, shares, and connects to whatever AI you already use. |
| Subtext | "Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and more." |

## Competitive Positioning

**Different category. Not diet Gong.**

Gong is the coach. CallVault is the film room and wiring.

Gong and Chorus are conversation intelligence applications — their AI, their analytics, their UI. You use Gong to get Gong's insights. CallVault is the call data and workspace layer — an organized, permissioned library that plugs into any AI. You use CallVault to get context into whatever AI you already trust.

Never frame CallVault as "Gong without AI lock-in" or "Gong for Claude users." Those framings live inside Gong's category. This framing does not.
