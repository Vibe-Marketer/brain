<objective>
Write the AI Strategy document (STRAT-01) and Product Identity document (STRAT-03) that lock CallVault's positioning before any v2 code is written.

Purpose: Every subsequent phase decision depends on these two answers: "What kind of AI product are we?" and "Who are we and what are we NOT?" Without these locked in writing, mid-build pivots are inevitable.

Output: Two markdown documents in the phase directory — AI-STRATEGY.md and PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write AI Strategy Document (STRAT-01)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/AI-STRATEGY.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/AI-STRATEGY.md` — a decisive strategy brief (not a comparison document).

Structure the document with these sections:
1. **Executive Summary** (3-4 sentences) — Open with the answer: CallVault is MCP-first with a lightweight bridge chat. State this as a decision, not a recommendation.
2. **The Decision** — MCP-first means: CallVault stores and organizes calls, then hands them to whatever AI the user already uses (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.). The only in-app AI is a lightweight bridge chat for quick questions about selected transcripts.
3. **What We Keep** — Smart Import (auto-title, action items, tags, sentiment at import time — one-time, not interactive). This is a named feature: "Smart Import." Label in-product: "Auto-generated — edit anytime." No "AI" label on it. Framing: "Calls arrive pre-organized."
4. **What We Drop** — Full RAG pipeline, embeddings, vector search, Content Hub, Langfuse observability, AI-powered automation rules, semantic search. No new embedding jobs. Per-call embedding cost = $0.
5. **What Is Optional Later** — Bridge chat (transcript-in-context, no RAG, no sessions — architecture decided in Phase 21 via AI-01). OpenRouter dependency is contained: only used for bridge chat if chosen.
6. **Marketing Angle** — "AI-ready, not AI-powered." Never say "AI-powered" anywhere. Lead with outcome ("Ask AI about any call, instantly"), MCP is the mechanism explained one layer down. Dev/integrations page can lead with "MCP-native call workspace."
7. **What This Means for Development** — No RAG code in new repo ever (AI-02 constraint). No embeddings. No vectors. Keyword search (pg_trgm) replaces semantic search. Smart Import enrichment continues running at import time via existing edge functions.
8. **Decision Confidence** — This is final. Not a comparison. Not "both have tradeoffs." This IS the decision. Explicitly state: "This document is the authoritative answer. It is not open for revisiting."

Tone: Confident, direct. Every sentence is a statement, not a suggestion. No hedging.
Length: 1-2 pages, readable in under 3 minutes.

CRITICAL constraints:
- Do NOT use "AI-powered" anywhere except in the context of what we are dropping/avoiding
- Do NOT mention coaches as a primary persona (they are tactical early adopters, not the strategic target)
- Do NOT list alternatives or say "you could also consider"
- Do NOT reference old v1 tier names (Solo, Business)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Product Identity Document (STRAT-03)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md` — a one-page reference document (target: readable in under 2 minutes).

Structure the document with these sections:

1. **What CallVault Is** (2-3 sentences) — The organized call workspace that captures, organizes, and exposes your calls to whatever AI you already use. Import from Fathom, Zoom, YouTube. Organize into Workspaces and Folders. Connect to Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini via MCP.

2. **Who It's For** — Primary buyer persona: Heads of Sales / RevOps at B2B companies with 5-50 reps doing Zoom sales calls. Include qualifying signals: team uses Fathom/Zoom for recording, has 50+ calls/month across the team, wants AI analysis but doesn't want Gong's price tag or AI lock-in, needs to share call context across reps/managers. Secondary/tactical: Coaches and consultants (early adopters, testimonials, referral channels into sales teams — not the strategic buyer).

3. **Who It's NOT For** — Individual consumers recording personal calls. Companies wanting a full conversation intelligence platform (scorecards, pipeline forecasting, coaching dashboards). Teams looking for a CRM or deal management system. Anyone wanting us to BE their AI.

4. **What Makes Us Different** (3 bullets max):
   - AI-agnostic: works with whatever AI you already use (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) via MCP
   - Workspace-first organization: Organization > Workspace > Folder hierarchy with permissions, sharing, and routing rules
   - A fraction of the cost of conversation intelligence platforms (do NOT name Gong directly — reference the category)

5. **What We Are NOT** (five-point anti-identity — make this PROMINENT, not buried):
   1. Not a recorder or transcription tool — calls are imported from tools you already use
   2. Not an AI assistant or coach — we don't replace Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini
   3. Not an analytics / intelligence platform — no pipeline forecasting, dashboards, scorecards
   4. Not a CRM or system-of-record for deals — we're the call layer, not the account database
   5. Not "AI-powered everything" — we're AI-ready, not AI-powered

6. **The One-Liner** — "Close more deals from the calls you're already having."

7. **Messaging Hierarchy**:
   - Hook (benefit): "Close more deals from the calls you're already having."
   - Category (positioning): "The operating system for your sales calls."
   - Mechanism (how): Captures, organizes, shares, connects to whatever AI you already use.
   - Subtext: "Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity and more."

8. **Competitive Positioning** — Different category, not diet Gong. "Gong is the coach. CallVault is the film room and wiring." Gong/Chorus = conversation intelligence apps (their AI, their analytics, their UI). CallVault = call data + workspace layer (organized, permissioned library that plugs into any AI). Never frame as "Gong without AI lock-in" or "Gong for Claude users" — those keep you in their category.

CRITICAL constraints:
- Total length: 1 page (aim for 400-600 words)
- Anti-identity section must be visually prominent (not buried at the bottom — place it after "Who It's For" or "What Makes Us Different")
- Primary persona is B2B sales teams / RevOps — NOT solo reps, NOT coaches as primary
- Zero instances of "AI-powered" used positively
- Zero instances of old naming (Bank, Vault, Hub, Solo tier, Business tier)

Phase-level checks for Plan 01:
1. Both documents exist in `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/`
2. AI-STRATEGY.md is decisive (MCP-first, no hedging, confidence statement)
3. PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md is concise (under 600 words, 2-minute read)
4. Neither document uses "AI-powered" positively, old v1 naming, or old personas
5. Both documents align: AI strategy's "AI-ready not AI-powered" reflected in product identity's anti-identity point 5

<success_criteria>
- AI-STRATEGY.md answers "do we have AI in our product?" with a confident, documented answer (STRAT-01 complete)
- PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md is readable in under 2 minutes and defines what CallVault is, who it's for, and what it is NOT (STRAT-03 complete)
- Both documents are consistent with each other and with CONTEXT.md locked decisions
