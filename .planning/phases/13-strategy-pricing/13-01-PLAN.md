<objective>
Write the AI strategy document (STRAT-01) and product identity document (STRAT-03) for CallVault v2.

Purpose: Lock the two foundational "who are we?" decisions before any code is written. Every subsequent phase depends on these answers — pricing (what we charge for), features (what we build), and messaging (how we talk about it) all flow from AI strategy and product identity.

Output: Two markdown documents in the phase directory that serve as authoritative reference for all v2 development.

  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/AI-STRATEGY.md` — the definitive AI strategy document for CallVault v2.

Per user decision (LOCKED): CallVault v2 is MCP-first with optional bridge chat.

Document structure:
1. **Executive Summary** (3-4 sentences): CallVault is a data layer for call recordings, not an AI product. AI happens elsewhere via MCP. Bridge chat is optional, not core.
2. **The Question Answered**: "Do we have AI in our product?" — Answer: No. We have AI *connectivity* (MCP) and one-time AI *enrichment* (auto-title, tags, sentiment at import). We do NOT have interactive AI as a product feature. Bridge chat, if added later (Phase 19-21), is a convenience, not the value proposition.
3. **What This Means for Development**:
   - MCP is infrastructure, not a feature to market
   - Polar tiers are NOT priced on AI usage
   - No RAG pipeline, no embeddings, no vector search in new repo
   - Smart import enrichment (auto-title, action items, tags, sentiment) continues — it's one-time at import, not interactive
   - Bridge chat (~100 lines) is optional Phase 21 work — select calls, concatenate transcripts, single LLM call, stream response
4. **Marketing Angle**: "Your calls, organized. Your AI, connected." — We don't sell AI. We sell organization + connectivity.
5. **What We Keep vs What We Drop**:
   - KEEP: Smart import enrichment (one-time), MCP server (infrastructure), keyword search (pg_trgm)
   - DROP: RAG pipeline, embedding pipeline, Content Hub, PROFITS, AI model management, Langfuse, semantic search, chat-stream v1/v2
   - OPTIONAL LATER: Bridge chat (Phase 21, ~100 lines, no RAG)
6. **Decision Confidence**: This is NOT "both have tradeoffs." This IS the decision. MCP-first. Period.

Tone: Confident, direct, no hedging. This is a strategy document, not a comparison doc.
Length: 1-2 pages maximum.

  <verify>File exists at `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/AI-STRATEGY.md`. Contains "MCP-first" positioning. Does NOT contain phrases like "both approaches have merit" or "we could go either way." Contains a clear KEEP/DROP/OPTIONAL section. Readable in under 3 minutes.</verify>
  <done>AI strategy document exists with a confident, singular recommendation. The question "do we have AI in our product?" has a definitive documented answer: No — we have AI connectivity (MCP) and one-time AI enrichment, not interactive AI.</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write Product Identity Document (STRAT-03)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md` — the one-page product identity for CallVault v2.

Per user decisions (LOCKED):
- Target customer: Solo sales rep / coach with 10-50 calls/week
- NOT for: Enterprise teams (Gong/Chorus), casual users (1-2 calls/month)
- FOR: Individual contributors doing discovery calls, coaching sessions, CS check-ins
- Messaging: "Stop losing call context. CallVault organizes your recordings so your AI actually knows what happened."

Document structure (must fit on ONE page — under 500 words):

1. **What CallVault Is** (2-3 sentences): A clarity-first organized call workspace. Users import calls from anywhere, organize them into workspaces, and expose structured context to whatever AI they already use. CallVault is a data layer, not an AI product.

2. **Who It's For** (specific personas with volume):
   - Sales rep at 10-50 person B2B SaaS doing 15-30 discovery calls/week
   - Solo coach with 15-20 client sessions/week
   - Recruiter doing 30+ phone screens/month
   - CS manager tracking 10-15 ongoing client conversations/week
   Common thread: They do enough calls to need organization, but not enough to justify Gong ($100K+/year).

3. **Who It's NOT For** (explicit exclusions):
   - Enterprise sales teams (they have Gong, Chorus, Clari)
   - Casual users with 1-2 calls/month (not enough pain to pay)
   - People looking for an AI chatbot (we don't have one)

4. **What Makes Us Different** (3 bullets max):
   - Workspace clarity: Organization > Workspace > Folder > Call — your calls are never lost or unorganized
   - AI-agnostic: Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any MCP client — we don't lock you into our AI
   - Import from anywhere: Fathom, Zoom, YouTube, file upload — one workspace for all your calls

5. **The One-Liner**: "Your calls, organized. Your AI, connected."

6. **What We Are NOT**:
   - Not an AI chatbot
   - Not a transcription service (we import transcripts, we don't create them)
   - Not enterprise sales intelligence (no deal tracking, no pipeline analytics)
   - Not a recording tool (we import recordings, we don't record)

Tone: Clear, confident, human. Written so a non-technical person understands immediately.
Format: Markdown with clear headers. Must be readable in under 2 minutes.

  <verify>File exists at `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md`. Contains all 6 sections. Under 500 words. Contains specific personas (sales rep, coach, recruiter, CS manager). Contains explicit "NOT for" section. Contains the one-liner. Readable in under 2 minutes.</verify>
  <done>Product identity document exists as a single page that anyone can read in under 2 minutes and know: what CallVault is (organized call workspace), who it's for (solo reps/coaches with 10-50 calls/week), and what it is NOT (not an AI chatbot, not Gong, not a recording tool).</done>

1. Both documents exist in `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/`
2. AI-STRATEGY.md contains a confident recommendation, not a comparison
3. PRODUCT-IDENTITY.md is under 500 words and readable in under 2 minutes
4. Neither document contradicts the locked user decisions
5. The AI strategy and product identity are consistent with each other (both say "data layer, not AI product")
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- AI strategy document answers "do we have AI in our product?" definitively: No. We have AI connectivity and one-time enrichment.
- Product identity document answers "what is CallVault?" in under 2 minutes: A clarity-first organized call workspace for solo reps/coaches with 10-50 calls/week.
- Both documents are confident and singular — no hedging, no "it depends."
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/13-01-SUMMARY.md`
