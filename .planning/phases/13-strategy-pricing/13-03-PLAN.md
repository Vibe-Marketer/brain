<objective>
Update Polar billing tiers to reflect CallVault v2 product identity (BILL-02) and log the changes.

Purpose: Polar currently has v1 tier names (Solo/Team/Business) with "AI-powered" messaging. Before Phase 14 begins, Polar must reflect the v2 identity: organized call workspace, no AI claims, Pro/Business naming. This is a dashboard update task followed by documentation.

Output: Updated Polar products and a change log documenting what was modified.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Prepare Polar Update Specification</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md` with the exact changes to make in Polar Dashboard.

Reference PRICING-TIERS.md (from Plan 02) for the authoritative tier definitions.

Document structure:

1. **Current State (v1)** — What's in Polar now:
   - Solo ($29/month): "AI-powered call intelligence for individuals" (or whatever the current description is)
   - Team ($99/month): "AI-powered team collaboration" (or similar)
   - Business ($249/month): "Enterprise AI call analytics" (or similar)

2. **Target State (v2)** — What Polar should say after update:

   **Pro** ($29/month, $24/month annual):
   - Name: "Pro"
   - Description: "Organized call workspace for professionals. 15 workspaces, 500 imports/month, full MCP access, Fathom/Zoom/YouTube connectors, import routing rules, all export formats, public sharing."
   - Key messaging: Zero AI claims. "Organized" not "intelligent." "Workspace" not "analytics."

   **Business** ($79/month, $66/month annual):
   - Name: "Business"
   - Description: "Scale your call organization. Unlimited workspaces and imports, team collaboration (25 members/workspace), all connectors including Zapier, unlimited routing rules, embeddable call player."
   - Key messaging: Scale and team features. Still zero AI claims.

   **NOTE on pricing changes:** If v1 Business was $249/month and v2 Business is $79/month, this is a significant price reduction. The user needs to decide whether to:
   - (a) Create new Polar products at the new price points and archive the old ones
   - (b) Update existing products in place (may affect existing subscribers)
   - Flag this as a decision point for the checkpoint.

3. **Changes Checklist** — Exact items to verify after update:
   - [ ] Product "Solo" renamed to "Pro" (or new product created)
   - [ ] Product "Team" archived/removed (v2 has no Team tier)
   - [ ] Product "Business" updated to $79/month (or new product created)
   - [ ] All product descriptions purged of: "AI-powered", "intelligent", "AI analytics", "machine learning", "embeddings", "RAG"
   - [ ] All product descriptions include: "organized", "workspace", "call recordings", "import"
   - [ ] Annual pricing variants created/updated if they exist
   - [ ] Webhook configuration still active (polar-webhook endpoint unchanged)
   - [ ] No disruption to existing subscribers during transition

4. **Rollback Plan**: If something goes wrong, document what was changed so it can be reverted.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md`. Contains current state, target state, and changes checklist. Target state descriptions contain zero AI-related language. Product names are Pro and Business (not Solo/Team/Business).</verify>
  <done>Polar update specification document is complete with exact before/after for each product, a changes checklist, and a rollback plan.</done>

  <name>Task 2: User Updates Polar Dashboard and Verifies</name>
  <what-built>A complete specification of Polar changes (POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md) ready for the user to execute in the Polar Dashboard. The specification includes exact product names, descriptions, pricing, and a verification checklist.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Open Polar Dashboard (https://polar.sh/dashboard)
    2. Navigate to Products
    3. For each product, compare current state against the POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md specification:
       - Rename "Solo" to "Pro" (or create new product)
       - Archive "Team" tier (v2 has only Free/Pro/Business)
       - Update "Business" pricing to $79/month (or create new product at new price)
       - Update ALL descriptions to remove AI-powered language
       - Verify descriptions say "organized call workspace" not "AI-powered intelligence"
    4. Verify annual pricing variants are updated
    5. Confirm existing webhook configuration is unchanged
    6. Update the checklist items in POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md with actual results
    7. Take note of any decisions made (new products vs updated, pricing transition plan)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "polar updated" with any notes about decisions made (new products vs updated in place, transition plan for existing subscribers), or describe issues encountered.</resume-signal>
