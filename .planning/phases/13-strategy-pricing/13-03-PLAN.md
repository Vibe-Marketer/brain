<objective>
Update the Polar billing dashboard to reflect v2 product identity and pricing, then document all changes in a POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md.

Purpose: Polar is the live billing system. Its product names, descriptions, and pricing must match the v2 identity (Free/Pro/Team, no "AI-powered" claims) before Phase 14 builds checkout flows against it. Old "AI-powered call intelligence" messaging must be purged.

Output: Updated Polar dashboard products + POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md documenting all changes.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Draft Polar Update Spec and Document Changes</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md` — a detailed spec of exactly what needs to change in the Polar dashboard, then document what was done.

Reference the PRICING-TIERS.md (from Plan 13-02 SUMMARY) for the authoritative tier definitions.

The document should contain:

1. **Current State (v1 Polar Products)** — Document what currently exists:
   - Solo product: name, description, price, billing interval
   - Team product: name, description, price, billing interval
   - Business product: name, description, price, billing interval
   - Note: These details come from PROJECT.md and the Polar dashboard

2. **Target State (v2 Polar Products)** — What must exist after update:
   - Pro Monthly: $29/month, description emphasizing workspace organization + MCP access, zero AI claims
   - Pro Annual: $278/year ($23/month displayed), same description pattern
   - Team Monthly: $79/month (flat, not per-seat), description emphasizing collaboration + admin + per-workspace MCP tokens, zero AI claims
   - Team Annual: $758/year ($63/month displayed), same description pattern
   - Free tier: No Polar product needed (free users have no subscription)

3. **Migration Plan** — For each v1 product, document the action:

   Format per product:
   ```
   ## [Old Name] -> [New Name/Action]

   | Field | Current (v1) | Target (v2) | Can Change? |
   |-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
   | Name | [old] | [new] | YES |
   | Description | [old] | [new - no AI claims] | YES |
   | Price | [old] | [new] | New subs only |
   | Billing interval | [old] | [old] | NO |

   Action: [Rename in-place / Archive + create new / Archive only]
   Existing subscriber impact: [describe]
   ```

   Key Polar constraints (from RESEARCH.md):
   - Product name and description CAN be edited after creation
   - Billing cycle, pricing type, and recurring interval CANNOT be changed
   - Price changes apply only to NEW purchases — existing subscribers keep original pricing
   - Annual billing = SEPARATE product (not a toggle)
   - Products can be archived (existing subscribers keep access, new purchases disabled)

4. **Decision Points for User** — Flag decisions that require human input:
   - If Solo price ($29) matches Pro price ($29): rename in-place (no subscriber impact)
   - If Business price differs from Team ($79): cannot change price for existing subs. Options: (a) archive Business + create Team at $79 (existing Business subs keep old access until they cancel), or (b) rename Business to Team and accept price mismatch for existing subs
   - Any new annual products that don't exist yet: must be created fresh

5. **Description Templates** — Draft v2 descriptions for each product (ready to paste into Polar):
   - Pro: Focus on "organized call workspace for serious professionals" — unlimited imports, multiple workspaces, full MCP access. "Your calls, ready for any AI." No "AI-powered" anywhere.
   - Team: Focus on "call workspace for your entire team" — everything in Pro plus shared workspaces, roles & permissions, per-workspace MCP tokens, admin dashboard. "Your team's calls, organized and connected." No "AI-powered" anywhere.

6. **Post-Update Verification Checklist**:
   - [ ] Zero Polar products contain "AI-powered" in name or description
   - [ ] Pro product exists with correct name, description, price
   - [ ] Team product exists with correct name, description, price
   - [ ] Annual variants exist (Pro Annual, Team Annual) if applicable
   - [ ] Old Business product is archived (if it existed and was replaced)
   - [ ] Existing subscribers are unaffected (confirmed in Polar dashboard)

CRITICAL constraints:
- Do NOT make changes to Polar without the human checkpoint (Task 2)
- This task ONLY creates the spec document — actual Polar changes happen after user review
- Zero "AI-powered" language in any description template
- All tier names: Pro, Team (never Solo, Business)
  </action>

Read POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md and confirm:
1. Document exists with current state, target state, migration plan, decision points, description templates, and verification checklist
2. Description templates contain zero "AI-powered" language
3. All tier names are Pro/Team (no Solo/Business except in "current state" section)
4. Decision points for existing subscribers are flagged for user input
5. Polar constraints (what can/cannot change) are correctly documented
  </verify>
  <done>POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md exists with a complete migration spec from v1 Polar products (Solo/Team/Business) to v2 (Pro/Team), including description templates, decision points for existing subscribers, and a verification checklist.</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: User Reviews and Executes Polar Dashboard Changes</name>
  <what-built>
POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md contains the complete spec for updating Polar billing products from v1 (Solo/Team/Business with "AI-powered" messaging) to v2 (Pro/Team with workspace + MCP messaging, zero AI claims).

The spec includes:
- Exact product renames and description changes
- Price point decisions
- Existing subscriber migration options
- Description templates ready to paste into Polar
- Post-update verification checklist
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Read `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md`
2. Review the migration plan — especially decisions about existing subscribers
3. Log into Polar dashboard (https://polar.sh)
4. Execute the changes described in the spec:
   - Rename products as specified
   - Update descriptions with the v2 templates
   - Archive products as specified
   - Create new products (annual variants) if needed
5. Run the verification checklist from the document
6. Come back and confirm what was done (or describe any deviations from the spec)

Key decisions requiring your input:
- What to do with existing Business subscribers (if any)
- Whether to archive + recreate or rename in-place for each product
- Whether annual variants need to be created now or deferred
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" with notes on what was changed in Polar, or describe any issues/deviations from the spec.</resume-signal>
</task>

Phase-level checks for Plan 03:
1. POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md exists with complete migration spec
2. User has reviewed and executed Polar changes
3. Zero Polar products contain "AI-powered" in name or description
4. Product names match v2 identity: Pro, Team
5. Existing subscribers are documented and handled

<success_criteria>
- Polar billing tiers have been updated with new tier names and descriptions that mention zero AI features (BILL-02 complete)
- Old "AI-powered" messaging is gone from all Polar product descriptions
- Changes are documented in POLAR-UPDATE-LOG.md for future reference
- Existing subscriber impact is understood and handled
</success_criteria>
