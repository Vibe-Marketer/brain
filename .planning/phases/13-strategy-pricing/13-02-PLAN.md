<objective>
Write the Pricing Tiers specification (STRAT-02, BILL-01, BILL-03) and Upgrade Prompts design document (BILL-04) that lock every pricing decision before v2 code is written.

Purpose: Phase 14+ will implement billing, gating, and upgrade flows. These documents are the authoritative spec for what to build. Without them, developers will guess at limits, copy, and behavior.

Output: Two markdown documents — PRICING-TIERS.md and UPGRADE-PROMPTS.md.

  <name>Task 1: Write Pricing Tiers Specification (STRAT-02, BILL-01, BILL-03)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRICING-TIERS.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRICING-TIERS.md` — the authoritative pricing spec for v2.

Structure the document with these sections:

1. **Pricing Philosophy** — What we charge for and why. Value is workspace organization + MCP connectivity + collaboration, NOT AI features. Frame using the $100M Offers "attraction offer" concept: Free gets people in and proves value, Pro converts serious solo users, Team upsells collaboration at higher ARPU. No Enterprise tier yet — "Team on enterprise terms" if asked.

2. **Tier Comparison Table** — Full feature matrix:

| Feature | Free | Pro | Team |
|---------|------|-----|------|
| Price | $0 | $29/mo | $79/mo (flat, not per-seat) |
| Annual | -- | $23/mo (billed $278/yr, 2 months free) | $63/mo (billed $758/yr, 2 months free) |
| Imports/month | 10 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Organizations | 1 | 1 | Multiple |
| Workspaces | 1 | Multiple | Multiple + shared |
| Folders | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Smart Import enrichment | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Keyword search | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| MCP access | None | Full personal | Per-workspace tokens + shared configs |
| Team members | -- | -- | Unlimited (flat rate) |
| Roles & permissions | -- | -- | Viewer/Member/Admin |
| Invite flows | -- | -- | Yes |
| Admin dashboard | -- | -- | Yes |
| Consolidated billing | -- | -- | Yes |
| Usage overview | -- | -- | Yes |
| Import routing rules | Basic | Full | Full + shared |
| Export (DOCX/PDF/TXT) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Public sharing links | Yes | Yes | Yes + embed player |

Note: Use Claude's discretion on the exact feature-per-tier breakdown for features not explicitly locked in CONTEXT.md (e.g., routing rules, export, sharing). The table above is the starting template — adjust based on what makes logical sense for value progression.

3. **Free Tier Deep Dive** — Rationale for each limit:
   - 10 imports/month: Enough for 2-3 days of a low-volume user. Proves the product works. Creates natural upgrade pressure within the first month.
   - 1 organization, 1 workspace: Enough to set up and organize. Second workspace triggers upgrade.
   - No MCP access: MCP is the paywall between Free and paid. Clean, single-sentence message: "MCP access requires Pro or Team."
   - Smart Import included: New users get the "calls arrive pre-organized" experience immediately. This is table stakes, not premium.
   - Keyword search included: Basic call discovery is free. Semantic search lives in the user's AI via MCP (not our concern).

4. **Pro Tier Deep Dive** — "Me + My AI + My calls" (solo power user):
   - Unlimited imports: Remove friction for serious users.
   - Multiple workspaces: Organize by client, project, or deal stage.
   - Full personal MCP access: Connect Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini to your workspace.
   - No collaboration features: Pro is for individuals. Team features trigger Team upgrade.

5. **Team Tier Deep Dive** — "Our org runs on this" (qualitatively different powers):
   - Everything in Pro, plus:
   - Multiple organizations: Support agencies or multi-division companies.
   - Shared workspaces with roles (Viewer/Member/Admin).
   - Per-workspace MCP tokens: Each workspace gets its own MCP connection with scoped access.
   - Admin dashboard, consolidated billing, usage overview.
   - Invite flows with clear "You're inviting [email] to [workspace] inside [org]" messaging.
   - $79/month FLAT (not per-seat) for early adoption. Per-seat pricing deferred to enterprise motion.

6. **Upgrade Triggers** — What causes conversions at each boundary:
   - Free -> Pro: Hit import limit (10/month), try to create second workspace, try to connect MCP.
   - Pro -> Team: Try to invite a teammate, try to create a second organization, try to generate per-workspace MCP token.

7. **What's Never Gated** (table stakes at ALL tiers):
   - Smart Import enrichment (auto-title, action items, tags)
   - Keyword search
   - Unlimited folders
   - Call detail view (full transcript, speakers, timestamps)
   - Export (basic formats)
   - Data retention (all data kept forever, never deleted on downgrade)

8. **Billing Configuration** — Monthly and annual available for Pro and Team. Annual = 20% discount (framed as "2 months free"). In Polar terms:
   - "Pro Monthly" = $29/month
   - "Pro Annual" = $278/year ($23.17/month, display as $23/month)
   - "Team Monthly" = $79/month
   - "Team Annual" = $758/year ($63.17/month, display as $63/month)

9. **Freemium + Trial Hybrid** — 14-day opt-in trial mechanics:
   - Free tier is permanent (free forever with limits).
   - Trial is opt-in: triggered when free user hits a premium feature. Modal: "This is a Pro feature. Start your 14-day free trial?"
   - User chooses when to burn the trial window.
   - Toast confirms: "You're on Pro until [date]."
   - After trial: drop back to Free automatically. Keep all data. Premium features become read-only.
   - Post-trial: User picks 1 "active" workspace to keep fully editable; rest become read-only. MCP configs stay visible but calls are blocked. Existing calls untouched; new imports hit free-tier cap.
   - Pro -> Team trial: Same pattern. Pro user hits Team feature -> "Start your 14-day Team trial?" After trial: drop to Pro (not Free).

10. **Polar Configuration Notes** — For the BILL-02 update task (Plan 13-03):
    - Current v1 products: Solo, Team, Business (from PROJECT.md)
    - v2 target: Pro (replaces Solo), Team (replaces Team/Business)
    - Products that can be renamed in-place: Solo -> Pro (if price unchanged at $29)
    - Products that need archive + recreate: Any with price changes
    - Existing subscriber impact must be documented
    - Annual variants = separate Polar products

CRITICAL constraints:
- All tier names must be Free, Pro, Team — NEVER Solo, Business, Enterprise
- No "AI-powered" features in any tier — framing is workspace, organization, MCP connectivity
- MCP is the Free/paid wall, NOT the Pro/Team wall
- Team differentiator is collaboration + admin controls, not just higher limits
- $79/month Team is FLAT rate, not per-seat
- Smart Import is table stakes (all tiers), not premium

  <name>Task 2: Write Upgrade Prompts Design Document (BILL-04)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/UPGRADE-PROMPTS.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/UPGRADE-PROMPTS.md` — the design spec for every in-context upgrade prompt. Developers implementing billing in Phase 14+ will use this as their reference.

Structure the document with these sections:

1. **Design Philosophy** — Soft gate at limit hits. Three behaviors on every prompt: (1) explain exactly why they're blocked, (2) show a preview of what upgrading unlocks for this specific context, (3) one obvious CTA + "Maybe later" secondary. Tone is educational, not punitive. Upgrade prompts appear ONLY where the limit is hit — never random, never global banners. No global sidebar indicator yet.

2. **Import Limit Prompt (Free -> Pro)**
   - Trigger: Free user attempts to import an 11th call in the current calendar month
   - Where: Import flow / import confirmation dialog
   - Headline: "You've reached your 10-call limit this month"
   - Body: "Free plan includes 10 imports per month. You've used all 10 this month."
   - Unlock preview: "Pro gives you unlimited imports + MCP access for $29/month."
   - Primary CTA: "Start free trial" (if trial not yet used) | "Upgrade to Pro" (if trial already used)
   - Secondary: "Maybe later" (dismiss, call is not imported)
   - On dismiss: Import is blocked. User returns to import flow. Counter resets on the 1st of each month.
   - Data: Nothing is lost. Existing 10 calls remain.

3. **Workspace Limit Prompt (Free -> Pro)**
   - Trigger: Free user attempts to create a second workspace
   - Where: Workspace creation dialog / "New Workspace" button
   - Headline: "Multiple workspaces are a Pro feature"
   - Body: "Free plan includes 1 workspace. You're using your workspace: [workspace name]."
   - Unlock preview: "Pro lets you create multiple workspaces to organize calls by client, project, or deal stage."
   - Primary CTA: "Start free trial" | "Upgrade to Pro"
   - Secondary: "Maybe later"
   - On dismiss: Workspace is not created. User stays on current workspace.

4. **MCP Access Prompt (Free -> Pro)**
   - Trigger: Free user navigates to MCP settings or attempts to generate an MCP token
   - Where: Workspace Settings > MCP section (or wherever MCP config lives)
   - Headline: "Connect your AI with MCP"
   - Body: "MCP lets Claude, ChatGPT, and Gemini access your calls directly. It's available on Pro and Team plans."
   - Unlock preview: "Pro gives you full personal MCP access for your workspace."
   - Primary CTA: "Start free trial" | "Upgrade to Pro"
   - Secondary: "Maybe later"
   - On dismiss: MCP settings page shows locked state. MCP configs are not visible.

5. **Team Feature Prompts (Pro -> Team)**
   - 5a. Invite teammate: Trigger when Pro user tries to invite someone. Headline: "Invite your team with Team plan." Body explains Team adds roles, shared workspaces, admin dashboard. CTA: "Start Team trial" (if Team trial not used) | "Upgrade to Team."
   - 5b. Multiple organizations: Trigger when Pro user tries to create a second org. Headline: "Multiple organizations are a Team feature." Body explains multi-org for agencies or divisions. Same CTA pattern.
   - 5c. Per-workspace MCP tokens: Trigger when Pro user tries to generate a workspace-scoped token (vs personal token). Headline: "Per-workspace MCP tokens are a Team feature." Body explains shared MCP configs for teams.

6. **Trial Opt-In Modal**
   - Trigger: Any upgrade CTA click when user has not used their trial
   - Where: Modal overlay (centered, dimmed background)
   - Headline: "Start your 14-day free trial of [Pro/Team]"
   - Body: "Try all [Pro/Team] features free for 14 days. No credit card required. After 14 days, you'll return to [current tier] automatically."
   - Primary CTA: "Start free trial"
   - Secondary: "Not now"
   - On confirm: Toast: "You're on [Pro/Team] until [date]. Enjoy!" Feature immediately unlocked.
   - After trial ends: Automatic downgrade to previous tier. No manual action required.

7. **Post-Trial Downgrade Messaging**
   - Trigger: Trial period ends
   - Where: Toast notification + banner on first login after trial ends + "Your Plan" section in settings
   - Toast: "Your 14-day [Pro/Team] trial has ended. Your data is safe."
   - Settings banner: "Your trial ended. Your data is safe. You're now on [Free/Pro]: [brief description of current limits]. Upgrade to keep going."
   - Post-trial behavior:
     - Nothing disappears. All data stays.
     - If downgrading from Pro to Free: User picks 1 "active" workspace to keep fully editable; rest become read-only (viewable, searchable, but can't add/edit).
     - MCP configs stay visible but calls are blocked.
     - Existing calls untouched; new imports hit free-tier cap.
   - CTA: "Upgrade to [Pro/Team]"
   - Secondary: "View plan details" (goes to settings plan page)

8. **Settings "Your Plan" Section**
   - Location: Settings page, persistent section
   - Contents:
     - Current plan name and status (Free / Pro / Team / Trial active until [date])
     - Usage bars: imports this month (X/10 for Free, unlimited for Pro/Team), workspaces (X/1 for Free), MCP tokens (0 for Free)
     - Upgrade path: clear "Upgrade" button if on Free or Pro
     - Billing details link (for paid users)
   - No global sidebar indicator yet (deferred per CONTEXT.md)

9. **Implementation Notes for Developers**
   - All upgrade prompts are frontend-only (no backend gating logic in these prompts — backend enforces limits separately)
   - Use a shared `UpgradeGate` component pattern: wraps any feature, checks tier, shows prompt if blocked
   - Prompt copy should be stored as constants (not hardcoded in components) for easy iteration
   - Trial state tracked via Polar subscription status + local state
   - Calendar month reset for import counter: use UTC month boundaries
   - "Maybe later" dismisses for the current session only — prompt reappears on next attempt

CRITICAL constraints:
- Prompts appear ONLY at the point of limit hit — never random, never global banners
- Tone is educational, not punitive — "You've reached..." not "You can't..."
- Every prompt has exactly: headline + body + unlock preview + primary CTA + secondary dismiss
- Trial is opt-in (user explicitly starts it), not opt-out
- Post-trial: keep ALL data, read-only on premium features, clear messaging about what's preserved
- No "AI-powered" language in any prompt copy
