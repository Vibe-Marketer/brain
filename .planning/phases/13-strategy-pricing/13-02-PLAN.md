<objective>
Define the complete pricing model (STRAT-02, BILL-01), free tier specification (BILL-03), and upgrade prompt designs (BILL-04) for CallVault v2.

Purpose: Pricing must be locked before the first line of code is written. Every feature decision in Phases 14-22 depends on knowing what's free vs paid. The upgrade prompts must be designed now because they influence UI architecture (where limit checks happen, what components to build).

Output: Two markdown documents — a complete pricing/tier specification and an upgrade prompt design guide.

  <name>Task 1: Write Pricing Tiers Specification (STRAT-02, BILL-01, BILL-03)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRICING-TIERS.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/PRICING-TIERS.md` — the complete pricing model for CallVault v2.

Per user decisions (LOCKED):
- Value anchor: Workspace organization + MCP access
- NOT priced on: AI queries, transcripts, storage
- Free tier: 3 workspaces, 50 imports/month, read-only MCP, basic connectors
- Paid unlock: Scale (more workspaces, unlimited imports) + automation (Zapier webhooks, advanced connectors)

Document structure:

1. **Pricing Philosophy** (3-4 sentences): We charge for organization scale and workflow automation. NOT for AI usage, NOT for storage, NOT for transcripts. MCP is infrastructure that scales with the workspace tier, not a separate line item. Free tier gives a real taste — limited enough to convert, generous enough to be useful.

2. **Tier Comparison Table** — Full feature matrix:

| Feature | Free | Pro | Business |
|---------|------|-----|----------|
| Workspaces | 3 | 15 | Unlimited |
| Imports/month | 50 | 500 | Unlimited |
| MCP access | Read-only | Full CRUD | Full CRUD + admin tools |
| Connectors | File upload only | Fathom, Zoom, YouTube | All + Zapier webhooks |
| Folders per workspace | 5 | 25 | Unlimited |
| Members per workspace | 1 (solo) | 5 | 25 |
| Import routing rules | 0 | 10 | Unlimited |
| Export formats | Plain text only | All (DOCX, PDF, text) | All + bulk ZIP |
| Public sharing | No | Yes | Yes + embeddable player |
| Bridge chat (if added) | No | Yes | Yes |
| Support | Community | Email | Priority |

NOTE on tier naming: v1 used Solo/Team/Business. v2 should use Free/Pro/Business to align with the "individual contributor scaling up" narrative (per user's target customer). The user may want to adjust naming — use Free/Pro/Business as the starting point.

3. **Pricing** (monthly/annual):
   - Free: $0
   - Pro: $29/month ($24/month billed annually)
   - Business: $79/month ($66/month billed annually)

   NOTE: v1 pricing was Solo $29/Team $99/Business $249. v2 drops the Team tier (target customer is solo contributor, not teams) and repositions Business at $79 (removes enterprise pricing signal). Pro at $29 is the natural upgrade for the solo rep/coach target customer. These are starting points — the user makes the final call on exact pricing.

4. **Free Tier Deep Dive (BILL-03)**:
   - 3 workspaces: Enough for "Prospects", "Clients", "Internal" — the three most common buckets
   - 50 imports/month: Covers 2-3 weeks of a 15-call/week user — they hit the limit before the month ends, creating natural upgrade pressure
   - Read-only MCP: Can query workspaces and read transcripts via Claude/ChatGPT, but cannot create/update/delete via AI — enough to show MCP value, limited enough to upgrade
   - File upload only: No Fathom/Zoom/YouTube connectors — manual import works, automated doesn't
   - 5 folders per workspace: Enough for basic organization, not enough for detailed categorization
   - No routing rules: Must manually assign calls to workspaces/folders
   - Plain text export only: Useful but not the full experience
   - No public sharing: Cannot share calls externally

5. **Upgrade Triggers** (what makes users convert):
   - Hit workspace limit: "I need a 4th workspace for Partners" — most common
   - Hit import limit: "I do 60+ calls/month and hit the cap" — volume users
   - Want automation: Zapier, Zoom auto-import, routing rules — workflow users
   - Want full MCP: AI can create workspaces, tag calls, move recordings — power users
   - Want sharing: Need to share calls with clients or embed recordings — coaches

6. **What's NOT Gated** (table stakes at every tier):
   - Transcripts: Every imported call gets its transcript
   - Search: Keyword search works at every tier
   - Auto-enrichment: Title, tags, sentiment, action items generated at import for every call
   - Basic organization: Workspaces and folders exist at every tier (just limited in count)

7. **Polar Configuration Notes** (for Plan 03):
   - Product IDs: `free` (no product needed), `pro-monthly`, `pro-annual`, `business-monthly`, `business-annual`
   - Descriptions must NOT mention AI features — "organized call workspace" not "AI-powered call intelligence"
   - Update Polar product names from v1 (Solo/Team/Business) to v2 (Pro/Business)
   - Remove any "AI-powered" or "intelligent" language from tier descriptions

  <name>Task 2: Design Upgrade Prompts (BILL-04)</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/UPGRADE-PROMPTS.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.planning/phases/13-strategy-pricing/UPGRADE-PROMPTS.md` — upgrade prompt designs for every limit hit in CallVault v2.

Per user decision (LOCKED): Upgrade prompts appear in context when user hits a limit.

Document structure:

1. **Upgrade Prompt Philosophy**: Prompts appear AT the moment of friction, not before. They explain what the user is trying to do, why they can't, and how upgrading fixes it. Never guilt-trip. Never block the entire UI. Always show what they'd get.

2. **Prompt Designs** — For each limit, define:
   - **Trigger condition**: Exact moment the prompt appears
   - **Where it appears**: Which UI surface
   - **Copy**: Headline + body + CTA button text
   - **Behavior**: What happens on dismiss, what happens on click

   Limits to cover:

   a. **Workspace limit** (Free: 3 workspaces)
   - Trigger: User clicks "Create Workspace" when at limit
   - Where: Inline in the create workspace dialog/flow
   - Headline: "You've used all 3 free workspaces"
   - Body: "Pro gives you 15 workspaces — enough for every client, project, and team."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"
   - Dismiss: Dialog closes, user stays on current page

   b. **Import limit** (Free: 50/month)
   - Trigger: User attempts import when monthly count >= 50
   - Where: Inline in the import flow (replaces import button)
   - Headline: "You've hit your 50 import limit this month"
   - Body: "Pro gives you 500 imports/month. Business gives you unlimited."
   - CTA: "See Plans"
   - Dismiss: Import flow closes
   - NOTE: Show current count ("42/50 imports used this month") in import UI BEFORE they hit the limit — no surprise

   c. **MCP write access** (Free: read-only)
   - Trigger: MCP client attempts a write operation (create workspace, tag call, etc.)
   - Where: MCP returns a structured error with upgrade info (not a UI prompt — this happens in the AI client)
   - Response: `{ "error": "mcp_write_denied", "message": "Free tier has read-only MCP access. Upgrade to Pro for full CRUD.", "upgrade_url": "https://callvault.app/settings/billing" }`
   - NOTE: This is an API-level response, not a UI component

   d. **Connector access** (Free: file upload only)
   - Trigger: User clicks a connector (Fathom, Zoom, YouTube) in import hub
   - Where: Inline in the connector card
   - Headline: "Fathom integration requires Pro"
   - Body: "Connect Fathom to auto-import your calls. Pro includes Fathom, Zoom, and YouTube."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"
   - Dismiss: Card returns to locked state

   e. **Folder limit** (Free: 5 per workspace)
   - Trigger: User clicks "Create Folder" when at limit in a workspace
   - Where: Inline in the folder creation flow
   - Headline: "5 folders per workspace on Free"
   - Body: "Pro gives you 25 folders per workspace — organize by client, date, topic, or however you work."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"

   f. **Member limit** (Free: solo only)
   - Trigger: User clicks "Invite Member" to a workspace
   - Where: Inline in the invite dialog
   - Headline: "Workspace sharing requires Pro"
   - Body: "Pro lets you invite up to 5 members per workspace. Business supports 25."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"

   g. **Routing rules** (Free: 0 rules)
   - Trigger: User opens routing rules section or clicks "Create Rule"
   - Where: Inline in the rules UI
   - Headline: "Import routing rules require Pro"
   - Body: "Pro lets you create up to 10 rules that auto-assign calls to workspaces and folders at import."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"

   h. **Export format** (Free: plain text only)
   - Trigger: User selects DOCX or PDF in export dialog
   - Where: Inline in export format selector
   - Headline: "DOCX and PDF export require Pro"
   - Body: "Free includes plain text export. Pro unlocks all formats including DOCX, PDF, and bulk ZIP."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"

   i. **Public sharing** (Free: no sharing)
   - Trigger: User clicks "Share" on a call
   - Where: Inline in the share dialog
   - Headline: "Public sharing requires Pro"
   - Body: "Pro lets you generate public links for any call. Business adds embeddable call players."
   - CTA: "Upgrade to Pro"

3. **Design Principles for Upgrade Prompts**:
   - Show at moment of friction, never before
   - Always show what the user was trying to do (context-aware)
   - Include a count/progress indicator where applicable (e.g., "42/50 imports used")
   - CTA goes to billing settings page, not directly to Polar checkout (user should see all plans)
   - Dismiss should NEVER lose the user's work (if they were mid-flow, their progress is preserved)
   - Never block the entire page — prompts are inline, contextual, dismissible
   - Use Sonner toast for transient notifications, inline cards for actionable limits

4. **Implementation Notes for Developers**:
   - Create a shared `UpgradePrompt` component that accepts: `headline`, `body`, `cta`, `tierRequired` ("pro" | "business")
   - Limit checks should use the existing `useSubscription` hook's tier detection
   - Import count tracking needs a monthly counter (reset on 1st of month) — stored in user_profiles or a separate usage table
   - MCP write denial is server-side (edge function or Worker), not a UI component
