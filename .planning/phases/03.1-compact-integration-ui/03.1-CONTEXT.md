# Phase 3.1: Compact Integration UI - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-29
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign integration display from large cards to compact button/icons on the Sync page. Create a reusable IntegrationConnectModal component that works across Sync, Settings > Integrations, and onboarding. The modal handles both connection and disconnection flows.

## Implementation Decisions

### Compact button/icon design
- **Shape:** Square with rounded corners (grid-friendly, logo-focused)
- **Size:** Medium (56-64px) — fits 6-8 per row
- **Label:** Small text below icon (e.g., "Zoom") + tooltip on hover
- **Connected state:** Full color logo + green ring + small green checkmark badge (bottom corner) + info icon (top right corner, white circle with "i")
- **Disconnected state:** Reduced opacity (50-60%) logo + red ring
- **Info icon behavior:** Hover shows "Connected as user@email.com", click goes to Settings

### Connected/disconnected states
- **Disconnected click:** Opens modal immediately (no intermediate state)
- **Connected click:** Opens same modal with disconnect option
- **Visual distinction:** Ring color (green/red) + opacity treatment makes state obvious at a glance

### Modal content & flow
- **Disconnected modal shows:**
  - Integration logo + name
  - Requirements to connect (mirrors current Settings content)
  - What connecting enables (brief explanation)
  - "Connect to [Integration]" button
  - Link to sign up for Fathom if they don't have an account
- **Connected modal shows:**
  - "Connected as user@email.com"
  - Last synced timestamp (e.g., "Last synced: 2 hours ago")
  - Disconnect button
  - "Manage in Settings" link
- **Error handling:** Modal stays open, toast notification shows error, retry available in modal

### Cross-context consistency
- **Sync page:** Inline with section header — "Integrations" header with compact buttons next to it
- **Settings > Integrations:** List format with more details per integration (not compact buttons)
- **Onboarding:** Same modal, triggered from a prompted step ("Connect your first integration")
- **Component reuse:** IntegrationConnectModal is the same component everywhere, only the trigger differs

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact spacing and padding within the button
- Ring thickness and exact colors (should align with brand guidelines)
- Modal animation/transition style
- Exact positioning of checkmark and info badges
- How "Last synced" is calculated and displayed

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- The compact buttons should make room for 6+ integrations in a row at the top of the Sync page
- Connected state should look "ready to rock" — full color, vibrant
- Disconnected state should clearly look "off" and needing action
- The info icon (top right) on connected integrations provides quick access to account info + Settings link
- Fathom signup link in disconnected modal encourages users who don't have a notetaker yet
