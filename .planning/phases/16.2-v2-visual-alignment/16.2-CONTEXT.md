# Phase 16.2: V2 Visual Alignment with V1 - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-03-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Fix every visual drift between V2 (callvault.vercel.app) and V1 (app.callvaultai.com) so that V2 matches V1's approved light mode look exactly. The V1 visual audit is done (14 vibe orange contexts, 124 CSS tokens, all-page screenshots). Brand guidelines v4.4 and the design system skill with hex values are the spec. This phase is execution — apply the audit findings to V2 code. Light mode only (dark mode pending user approval, out of scope).

## Implementation Decisions

### Page-by-page scope
- ALL pages in V2 get aligned — no page is skipped
- Pages that exist in both V1 and V2: match V1 exactly
- V2-only pages (workspace management, onboarding, org switcher): must match V1's visual language (same colors, typography, spacing, component styles)
- Pages V1 had but V2 dropped (AI Chat, Content Hub, Hubs, Analytics): stay dropped, not in scope
- Claude screenshots each V2 page, compares to V1 where applicable, and flags anything that looks off
- Claude determines the best page order based on what's most broken
- Light mode only — dark mode is NOT in scope

### Matching standard
- **Exact match**: Same colors, same spacing, same font sizes, same component styling — side-by-side should look identical
- Animations: Claude compares V1 and V2 animation feel and adjusts only if V2 feels noticeably different (V2 uses spring physics, V1 used CSS transitions — the feel should match even if the technique differs)
- If V2 looks BETTER than V1 somewhere: screenshot both versions and ask the user which to keep
- If V1 has something that looks off/broken: screenshot it and ask the user whether to copy it or fix it in V2
- Default posture: match V1, escalate edge cases to user

### Component drift priorities
- Claude runs the full audit — user hasn't compared side-by-side yet
- No pre-identified broken components — Claude discovers everything via dev-browser screenshots
- Fix everything in one sweep — no batching by severity, no "critical first, polish later"
- Vibe orange: match V1's 14 documented structural contexts silently — add where V1 has it, remove where V1 doesn't, no need to ask per instance

### Verification approach
- Show BOTH: V1 vs V2 side-by-side AND V2 before/after fixes — full visual evidence
- Claude determines the most efficient verification flow (page-by-page vs batch)
- Quick checks on localhost:8080 during development for fast iteration
- Final verification on production (callvault.vercel.app) after deploy
- If screenshots look good, user accepts. If anything's borderline, user checks manually in browser.

### Claude's Discretion
- Page order (tackle most broken first vs user journey order)
- Verification flow (page-by-page fix+verify vs fix-all-then-verify)
- Animation tuning (only adjust if V2 springs feel noticeably different from V1 transitions)
- Technical approach for each fix (CSS changes, component refactors, token updates — whatever gets to visual match)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- V1 production at app.callvaultai.com is the visual source of truth (light mode approved)
- V1 screenshots from the audit session are in `~/.config/claude-code/dev-browser/tmp/v1-*.png`
- The design system skill (`callvault-design-system.md`) has the complete token reference with hex values for both light and dark mode
- Brand guidelines v4.4 (`docs/design/brand-guidelines-v4.4.md`) has all V1→V2 token conversions
- 14 structural vibe orange contexts are documented in the design system skill
- 124 CSS custom properties were extracted from V1's live DOM
- V2's tokens come from `callvault/src/globals.css` — this is the file to modify for color alignment
- The user is visual — screenshots are the proof, not code diffs

## Deferred Ideas

- **Dark mode alignment** — User hasn't approved V1 dark mode yet. Once approved, needs its own alignment pass.
- **create-brand-skill** — Reusable skill for capturing brand systems from any app (dev-browser for auth, Dembrandt for public). For CallVault and client work. Belongs in plugins-and-skills repo.
