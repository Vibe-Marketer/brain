# One-Click Promise Principles

## The Core Philosophy

**Every process should be reduced to as close to a single click as possible.**

**Simple scales. Complexity fails.**

We avoid *unnecessary* complexity. If it serves the customer, we build it. If it's just fancy, we cut it.

## The Decision Test

*Would a thoughtful person regret it if we just did this for them?*

- **No** → Do it. Don't ask.
- **Yes** → Ask once, simply, with a recommendation.

## The 10 Principles

### 1. Gather Silently, Confirm Minimally
Get the website. Scrape it. Present findings. "You sell X to Y—correct?" Yes/No. Store forever, reuse everywhere.

**Violations look like:**
- Asking users for information that's publicly available
- Open-ended questions when you have enough context to confirm
- Not storing/reusing previously gathered information

### 2. Radical Simplicity
Plain words. No jargon. 6th-8th grade level. "Who do you sell to?" not "Define your target avatar."

**Violations look like:**
- Industry jargon without explanation
- Complex sentence structures
- Academic or technical language when plain language works

### 3. Smart Defaults
Every option has an intelligent default. Blank fields are failures.

**Violations look like:**
- Empty form fields that could have sensible defaults
- Required selections with no recommended option
- Settings with no pre-configured state

### 4. Invisible Complexity
Users see simple. Systems handle complex.

**Violations look like:**
- Exposing technical details to users
- Making users understand how something works to use it
- Showing all options when most users need the default

### 5. Respect Cognitive Budget
Every decision costs the customer. Minimize withdrawals.

**Violations look like:**
- Too many choices presented at once
- Decisions that don't matter to the outcome
- Forcing users to context-switch mid-flow

### 6. Chain, Don't Fragment
One intent, one action, complete. No shepherding through steps.

**Violations look like:**
- Multi-page wizards for simple tasks
- "Click here to continue" patterns
- Breaking single tasks into multiple sessions

### 7. One Click is the Ceiling
Zero is better. If it can be anticipated and automated, do it.

**Violations look like:**
- Any action requiring multiple clicks that could be one
- Confirmation dialogs for low-risk actions
- Manual triggers for predictable automations

### 8. Fail Forward
Errors resolve automatically or with one click.

**Violations look like:**
- Error messages that just describe the problem
- Recovery requiring the user to figure out what went wrong
- Dead ends that require starting over

### 9. Challenge Everything
"It's always been done this way" is not a reason. Nothing is impossible.

**Violations look like:**
- Patterns copied from competitors without questioning
- "Industry standard" as justification for friction
- Accepting limitations without exploring alternatives

### 10. Less is More
One sentence beats a paragraph. Cut ruthlessly.

**Violations look like:**
- Verbose instructions
- Multiple paragraphs when one would do
- Explaining obvious things

## Agent Guidelines

For AI agents and automated systems, these additional rules apply:

1. **Check stored context** — What do we already know?
2. **Scrape before asking** — Analyze what exists
3. **Confirm, don't interrogate** — "You sell X?" not "What do you sell?"
4. **Yes/No is the goal** — Transform questions into confirmations
5. **Act when confident** — Inform what you did
6. **Store what you learn** — Compound the knowledge base
7. **If they're typing paragraphs, you failed**

## Scope of Application

- **Our customers** — Every product, feature, interaction
- **Their customers** — We enable one-click for end users too
- **Our team** — We operate this way internally
- **When we fail** — Fix it now. Then fix the system.
