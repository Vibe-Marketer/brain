# SEO Content Creation Workflow

<objective>
Create publish-ready content optimized for traditional search, featured snippets, and AI citation. Output: Complete article/page ready to publish.
</objective>

<inputs_required>
- Target keyword or topic
- Content type (blog, comparison, landing page, how-to, listicle)
- Your product/company name (if relevant)
- Competitors to mention (if comparison content)
- Target word count (or "let me determine based on competition")
</inputs_required>

<process>

## Phase 1: Quick Research (Before Writing)

1. Google the target keyword
2. Analyze top 3 results for:
   - Word count (match or exceed)
   - Topics covered (must include)
   - Gaps (opportunities to be better)
3. Extract PAA questions (will become H2s)
4. Note featured snippet format (will structure for capture)

## Phase 2: Content Structure

Based on research, create outline:
- Title (keyword near front, compelling)
- H1 (slightly different from title)
- H2s (cover all major topics + PAA questions)
- Featured snippet target section
- FAQ section (for additional PAA capture)

## Phase 3: Write Content

**Opening (First 100 words):**
- Include primary keyword
- Direct answer to search intent
- Hook that keeps reader engaged
- No fluff or "In this article we will..."

**Body Sections (Each H2):**
- If H2 is a question: Answer directly in first 40-60 words (snippet capture)
- Then expand with details, examples, data
- Include secondary keywords naturally
- Add specific numbers, named examples, citations (GEO optimization)

**Entity-Rich Writing Rules:**
- Use specific company/product names, not "a leading provider"
- Include statistics with sources
- Name real examples and case studies
- Add dates and timeframes for context

**For Each Section Include:**
- At least one specific statistic or data point
- At least one named example
- Internal link opportunity (note where)
- External citation if making claims

**Closing:**
- Summary of key points
- Clear CTA
- No weak endings ("I hope this helped")

## Phase 4: Optimization Pass

**SEO Checklist:**
- [ ] Primary keyword in title, H1, first 100 words, one H2, conclusion
- [ ] Secondary keywords distributed naturally
- [ ] All H2s are descriptive (not "Introduction")
- [ ] Internal link suggestions noted
- [ ] External citations included

**AEO Checklist:**
- [ ] Featured snippet section formatted correctly
- [ ] At least 3 Q&A formatted sections
- [ ] Answers are direct and complete (40-60 words)
- [ ] Lists use proper formatting (5-8 items)

**GEO Checklist:**
- [ ] Entity-rich (specific names throughout)
- [ ] Fact-dense (stat every 200 words)
- [ ] Contains quotable/citable content
- [ ] Comparison statements included (if relevant)

## Phase 5: Meta & Schema

**Write:**
- Meta title (< 60 chars with keyword)
- Meta description (< 160 chars with CTA)
- Suggested URL slug

**Specify Schema Needed:**
- Article schema (always)
- FAQPage schema (if FAQ section)
- HowTo schema (if step-by-step)

## Phase 6: Final Deliverable

Save complete document with:
1. Meta information (title, description, slug)
2. Full article content (formatted in markdown)
3. Schema markup code
4. Internal linking suggestions
5. Image suggestions (what visuals to add)

</process>
