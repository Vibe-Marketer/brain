## Overview

Redesign content cards to have a more polished, professional look rather than the current generic "vibe code AI" aesthetic.

## Problem Statement

Current content cards have a generic, auto-generated appearance that doesn't reflect the brand quality and may undermine user trust.

## Goals

1. Professional, intentional design
2. Alignment with brand guidelines
3. Visual differentiation from competitors

## User Stories

## Technical Approach

Full design audit and refresh of content card components following brand guidelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
