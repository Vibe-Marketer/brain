## Overview

Move edit pencil icons inside their associated input boxes rather than appearing as separate buttons outside the field.

2. Cleaner visual design
3. Standard UX pattern adherence

## User Stories

**US-037.1:** As a CallVault user, I want to click on a field to edit it so that the interaction is intuitive.

|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-001 | Edit icons inside input fields | Should Have |

| FR-003 | Consistent pattern across all fields | Must Have |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Edit icons inside input containers
- [ ] Click anywhere to edit
- [ ] Consistent across all editable fields
- [ ] Clear visual indication of editability
