## Overview

Rename "Call Content Generator" to something more descriptive like "Social Post Generator" that actually describes what the feature creates.

## Problem Statement

"Call Content Generator" is vague and doesn't explain what the feature produces. Users don't know what they'll get before using it.

## Goals

1. Clear, descriptive feature naming
2. Improved feature discovery
3. Instant understanding of purpose

## User Stories

**US-024.1:** As a CallVault user, I want the content generator to have a clear name so that I know what it creates before I use it.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-001 | Generator has descriptive name | Must Have |
| FR-002 | Name appears consistently everywhere | Must Have |
| FR-003 | Name describes output type | Must Have |

## Naming Options

- "Social Post Generator" (Recommended)
- "Post Generator"
- "Social Content Generator"
- "Generate Social Posts"

## Technical Approach

Update all UI labels and navigation references to use new name.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Generator has new descriptive name
- [ ] Name consistent across all locations
- [ ] Name clearly indicates output type
