⏺ Let me read the current UAT file and update it to record Test 2 as passed,
  then present Test 3.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The file already shows Test 2 as passed and Current Test is Test 3. Let me
  update the summary counts to reflect the correct totals.

  Test 3 of 8: Tool Call Three-State Display

  Go to /chat and trigger tool calls that produce different outcomes:

  Expected behavior:
  - Tools that find data → green checkmark with result count (e.g., "Searched
  Transcripts (3 results)")
  - Tools that find nothing → amber indicator with "0 results"
  - Tools that fail → red indicator with "Failed"

  How to test:
  1. Ask something that will find results: "What calls do I have?"
  2. Ask something that will return empty: "Search for calls about quantum
  computing" (assuming you have none)
  3. Observe whether you can visually distinguish between success with results,
  success with zero results, and errors

  Reply with pass, fail, or describe what you see.

✻ Churned for 1m 55s

❯ The tool calls/results are showing "Listen to the call" which is          
  inaccurate, we cannot "listen" to it, it's a video for starters and it's  
  a "transcript" not something that you listen to.. this should instead do  
  the same as clicking on the call in the list at the bottom and it should  
  allow you to "view meeting details" or something like that (think about   
  the best "phrasing" given the situation) .. I'm not able to get a         
  "FAILED" status as it appears as though all the "tools" are working at    
  least from what I can tell.. I don't know of a way to call a tool that    
  MAKES IT FAIL. ... ALSO .. Here's the "error" messages that are showin    
  gin the debugger as well: # CallVault Bug Report

⏺ I can see from the screenshot that the three-state display is working (green
  checkmarks for results, amber triangles for 0 results). Let me find and fix
  the "Listen to the call" text issue.

⏺ Searched for 3 patterns, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The tool-call.tsx doesn't contain "Listen to the call". Let me check the
  message component and sources section.

⏺ Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I found relevant text in source.tsx but it says "View full call" not "Listen
  to the call". Let me search for the exact text.

⏺ Searched for 2 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The text "Listen to the call" isn't in the frontend code. Let me check if it's
   in the tool definitions in the backend (chat-stream function) where the AI
  might be told to say this.

⏺ Searched for 5 patterns (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me check the system prompt in the legacy chat function where this text
  might be instructed.

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me search for "Listen" in the tool execution functions in the
  chat-stream-legacy file.

⏺ Searched for 1 pattern (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I found the relevant code in source.tsx. While the exact text "Listen to the
  call" isn't in the code (it shows "View full call" with a play icon), I'll fix
   the issues you identified:

  1. Change the play icon to a more appropriate "view" icon
  2. Update the text to "View meeting details"
  3. Update the fallback text as well

⏺ Test 3: PASS (partial - can't force a tool failure to test the red "Failed"
  state, but success/empty states confirmed)

  Fixed: Changed the hover card action text from "View full call" → "View
  meeting details" and replaced the play icon with a document icon in
  src/components/chat/source.tsx.

  Test 4 of 8: Inline Citations with Hover Preview

  Ask about specific content in your calls (e.g., "What did we discuss about
  pricing?" or "Summarize the key points from my recent calls").

  Expected behavior:
  - The AI response includes numbered citations like [1], [2] inline within the
  text
  - Hover over a citation number → a tooltip shows:
    - Call title
    - Speaker name
    - Date
    - Brief snippet from that source

  Reply with pass, fail, or describe what you see.

✻ Baked for 3m 2s

❯ FAIL -- NO.. if anything it's worse now.. there's not any                 
  inline/afterline citations showing before I liked that it showed "View"   
  or "Listen Here" even having it underlined (the meeting is underlined     
  right now) but I like the idea of having it actually say after "View      
  Meeting" but the links all open up in another window instead of just      
  opening the call details like it does in the links at the bottom of the   
  chat. See the atached images.

⏺ I see the issue now from your screenshots. Two problems:

  1. "Listen Here" links are gone - The model was generating these inline, but
  the response format changed
  2. Links open in a popup dialog instead of the detail panel like the Sources
  at the bottom

  Let me check how call detail viewing is handled to fix the link behavior.

⏺ Searched for 3 patterns, read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I see the issue. The DetailPaneOutlet doesn't have a call-detail panel type
  yet - it only supports folders, tags, settings, and users. The Chat page uses
  CallDetailDialog (a popup) instead.

  The user wants call details to open in Pane 4 (the detail panel) like other
  items, not as a popup dialog. This requires creating a CallDetailPanel
  component.

  Let me first check what the existing CallDetailDialog does so I can create a
  panel version.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ This is a significant architectural issue. The Call Detail currently only
  exists as a Dialog component - there's no Panel version for Pane 4. Let me
  update the UAT to record this failure and document the required fixes.

⏺ Read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ The UAT file was reverted. Let me update it with the correct test results.

      171  ### Timeline

⏺ ---
  Test 4: FAIL

  Issues Found:

  1. Inline "Listen Here" links are gone - The model's response format changed.
  Previously it included action links after each call reference, now it only
  shows underlined call titles.
  2. Architectural gap: Dialog vs Panel
    - Currently: CallDetailDialog (popup modal) is the only implementation
    - Expected: Call details should open in Pane 4 (the detail panel) like
  folders/tags
    - Missing: CallDetailPanel component doesn't exist
    - DetailPaneOutlet.tsx only supports folder-detail, tag-detail,
  setting-help, user-detail
    - The 'call-detail' type is defined in panelStore.ts but nothing renders it

  Required Fixes:

  1. Create src/components/panels/CallDetailPanel.tsx (adapt from Dialog)
  2. Add 'call-detail' case to DetailPaneOutlet.tsx
  3. Update Chat.tsx to use openPanel('call-detail', { recordingId }) instead of
   the dialog
  4. Consider updating system prompt to restore inline action links

  UAT Status:
  - Tests 1-3: PASS
  - Test 4: FAIL (blocking issue)
  - Tests 5-8: PENDING

  Do you want me to proceed with creating the CallDetailPanel component, or
  would you prefer to continue UAT testing first and fix these issues later?

  Test 5 of 8: Source List at Bottom of Message

  Look at an AI response that references your calls.

  Expected behavior:
  - A "Sources" section appears at the bottom of the message
  - It lists all referenced calls with their titles
  - Clicking a source opens the call detail view

  Note: Based on Test 4, clicking sources will open a popup dialog (not the side
   panel). For this test, just verify that:
  1. The Sources section appears
  2. It lists the correct calls
  3. Clicking opens some view of the call details (even if popup)

  Reply with pass, fail, or describe what you see.

  Test 6 of 8: Store Error Toast Notifications

  Try to trigger a store operation failure. This is tricky to test naturally,
  but you can try:
  - Disconnect your network briefly while saving content
  - Or just verify that toast notifications work in general when errors occur

  Expected behavior:
  - If a store operation fails (saving, deleting, etc.), a toast notification
  appears
  - The message should be user-friendly like "Couldn't save item. Please try
  again."
  - Errors should NOT be silent

  If you can't easily trigger a failure: Reply skip and we'll note this as
  untestable without mocking.

  Reply with pass, fail, skip, or describe what you see.

⏺ Great catch! The screenshot shows the Failed state DOES work - "Got Call
  Details — Failed" with red indicator. This actually validates Test 3 fully
  now.

  Also noting the issue: the model is sending wrong recording_id values (1, 2)
  instead of real IDs from the search results.

  Test 7: PASS — Chat stable across multiple messages and model switches.

  Bonus: Your screenshot confirmed Test 3's Failed state works (red "Got Call

  Bug noted: Model hallucinates recording_ids (sends 1, 2 instead of real IDs
  from search results).

  Test 8 of 8: Streaming Error Recovery

  Simulate a network interruption mid-stream (disconnect WiFi briefly while the
  AI is responding).

  Expected behavior:
  1. Partial response is preserved with an "Incomplete response" indicator
  2. Toast notification appears with a retry action
  3. Inline retry button appears below the incomplete message

  If you can't easily simulate this: Reply skip and we'll note it as untestable.

  Reply with pass, fail, skip, or describe what you see.

✻ Baked for 1m 20s

❯ I don't think it makes sense to test 8 since we already know that these   
  toasts aren't working. Should I still test?                               

⏺ You're right - the toast part will fail for the same reason as Test 6.

  However, the other parts are different features:
  - "Incomplete response" indicator on partial messages
  - Inline retry button

  If you want to quickly check those two things, go ahead. Otherwise, mark it
  skip with the note that toast issues are already tracked.

  Your call.

  - ✅ "Retry" button

  But there are issues:
  - ❌ 500+ console errors in seconds (runaway error loop - needs debouncing)
  - ❌ Partial response lost when WiFi restored (not persisted)

  Issues to Fix

  1. CallDetailPanel missing - Links open popup instead of Pane 4
  2. No error toasts - Silent failures, no user feedback
  3. Error spam - 500+ console errors on network loss (needs debouncing)
  4. Response not persisted - Partial response lost on reconnect
  5. Model hallucinates IDs - Sends fake recording_ids (1, 2)

❯ what's the next GSD workflow for addressing these isues? 

⏺ Based on GSD workflow, you have a few options:

  Option 1: /gsd:plan-milestone-gaps
  Creates phases to close all gaps identified. Best if these issues block
  milestone completion.

  Option 2: /gsd:insert-phase
  Insert a "Phase 2.1 - Chat Foundation Fixes" as a decimal phase between
  existing phases. Good for urgent fixes before moving on.

  Option 3: /gsd:add-phase
  Add a new phase at the end of the current milestone. Best if you want to
  continue with other work first.

  Option 4: /gsd:add-todo
  Capture each issue as a todo for later. Best if these are lower priority and
  you want to move on.

  Recommended: /gsd:insert-phase to create Phase 2.1 specifically for these 5
  issues, then /gsd:plan-phase 2.1 to create the execution plan.

  Which approach do you want to take?
