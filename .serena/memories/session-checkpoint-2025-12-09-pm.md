# Session Checkpoint - 2025-12-09 PM

## Session Focus
Minimal, incremental improvements to documentation and Serena memories to ensure consistency with brand-guidelines v4.1 and integrate the One-Click Promise philosophy.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. CLAUDE.md Backup
- Saved to `docs/archive/CLAUDE-backup-2025-12-09.md`
- Original already had correct v4.1 references and One-Click Promise section

### 2. Serena Memory Updates
- **brand-guidelines-summary**: Fixed v3.4 → v4.1 in Deviation Protocol section
- **task-completion-checklist**: Fixed v3.3 → v4.1, added One-Click Promise Friction Check section

### 3. New Memory Created
- **core-values**: Contains One-Click Promise philosophy, guiding principles, friction test checklist, and KISS-UX principle

## Key Decisions
- Kept changes minimal per user guidance ("REMEMBER SIMPLICITY")
- Did NOT rewrite CLAUDE.md - only verified it was correct
- Focused on fixing version inconsistencies in Serena memories
- Added friction check to task completion workflow

## System State
- All documentation now references brand-guidelines v4.1 consistently
- One-Click Promise is enforced in both CLAUDE.md and task-completion-checklist
- New core-values memory provides quick reference for philosophy
