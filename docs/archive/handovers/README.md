- **Historical Context:** Rationale for implementation decisions made during the session
- **Change Documentation:** Comprehensive record of what was modified and why

**Archive Policy:** Handovers are archived 30-60 days after creation once the changes are well-integrated.
**Retention:** Indefinite (preserved in git history)
**Access:** Available via git or archive directory
**Note:** For current implementation details, refer to the actual codebase and active documentation.
