  "task_description": "Component Deduplication & Reusability Audit\nObjective: Ensure all shared UI elements follow single-source-of-truth architecture—one change propagates everywhere.\nScope:\n\nSidebar component(s)\nMiddle pane / list views\nMain pane / detail views\nAny UI pattern appearing on 2+ pages\n\nActions:\n\nAudit — Scan the codebase for duplicate or near-duplicate component code across pages. Flag anything that's copy-pasted rather than imported.\nExtract — Refactor duplicated elements into shared components in /components/shared/ (or equivalent). This includes:\n\nComponent files\nDesign tokens (colors, spacing, typography)\nShared CSS/styles\n\n\nReplace — Update all instances to import from the single source. Remove orphaned duplicate code.\nVerify — Confirm that modifying the shared component updates every usage across the app.\n\nDeliverable: A codebase where layout shells (sidebar, panes) and repeated UI patterns exist in exactly one place.",
