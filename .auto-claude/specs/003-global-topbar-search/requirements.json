  "task_description": "# Global TopBar Search\n\nImplement search functionality in the TopBar component, allowing users to search across all transcripts, insights, and content from anywhere in the application. Includes quick-access keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+K).\n\n## Rationale\nSearch is a critical feature for power users managing hundreds of transcripts. This directly addresses the pain point of 'Difficult to organize and search through meeting archives' and competes with Fathom's basic search by offering universal access.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a sales professional, I want to quickly search for a specific client conversation so that I can reference past discussions before a follow-up call\n- As a marketer, I want to search for testimonials across all transcripts so that I can find authentic customer quotes for campaigns\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Search input is accessible from TopBar on all pages\n- [ ] Cmd/Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut opens search modal\n- [ ] Search results show transcripts, insights, and quotes\n- [ ] Results are clickable and navigate to the relevant item\n- [ ] Search is fast (< 500ms for most queries)\n",
