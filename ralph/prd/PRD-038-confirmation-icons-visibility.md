**Status:** Ready for Implementation

## Overview

Fix checkmark and X icon visibility. Currently gray and hard to see. Should use red X and green checkmark.

## Problem Statement

Gray icons lack visual distinction and may be missed by users. Standard UX uses color-coded confirm/cancel icons.

## Goals

1. Clear visual distinction for actions
2. Standard color coding
3. Improved accessibility

## User Stories

**US-038.1:** As a CallVault user editing settings, I want clear confirm/cancel buttons so that I know exactly what each action does.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-001 | Cancel/X icon is red | Must Have |
| FR-002 | Confirm/checkmark is green | Must Have |
| FR-003 | Both clearly visible | Must Have |
| FR-004 | Meet accessibility contrast | Must Have |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] X icon is red/destructive color
- [ ] Checkmark is green/success color
- [ ] Both clearly visible
- [ ] Sufficient contrast for accessibility
