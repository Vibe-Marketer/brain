**Status:** Ready for Implementation

**Category:** Content Section
**Spec:** [SPEC-026](../../specs/spec-026-call-cards-size.md)

## Overview

Reduce the height of call cards significantly. Current cards are too large with excessive wasted space.

## Problem Statement

Oversized cards mean fewer visible at once, making the list harder to scan. Excessive whitespace doesn't add value.

## Goals

1. More cards visible per screen
2. Better information density
3. Easier scanning and navigation

## User Stories

**US-026.1:** As a CallVault user browsing calls, I want compact call cards so that I can see more calls without scrolling.

## Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Priority |
|----|-------------|----------|
| FR-001 | Card height reduced by ~30-50% | Must Have |
| FR-002 | All essential info still visible | Must Have |
| FR-003 | More cards visible per screen | Must Have |
| FR-004 | No cramped or unreadable text | Must Have |

## Technical Approach

- Reduce card padding
- Tighten vertical spacing
- Maintain readability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cards visibly more compact
- [ ] Essential info still displayed
- [ ] More cards visible per screen
- [ ] Text remains readable
- [ ] Spacing consistent with other components
