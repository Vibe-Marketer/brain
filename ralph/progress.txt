# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Sidebar navigation is in `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - handles both expanded and collapsed modes
- SidebarNav receives `onSyncClick` callback for the Import button - this is passed from AppShell
- AppShell (`src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`) is the main layout component that renders SidebarNav
- Use `isCollapsed` prop to conditionally render different UI for expanded vs collapsed sidebar modes
- 500ms transitions are standard for sidebar animations (use `duration-500 ease-in-out`)

## 2026-01-14 - US-001.1: Import button at top of sidebar
- What was implemented:
  - Moved Import button (onSyncClick action) from bottom to top of SidebarNav
  - Added visual separator between Import button and nav items
  - Works in both expanded and collapsed sidebar modes
  - Maintains 500ms transitions and existing styling
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - restructured nav element ordering
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import button uses a gradient background with inline styles (`linear-gradient(135deg, #FFEB00 0%, #FF8800 50%, #FF3D00 100%)`)
  - Collapsed mode uses `w-8 h-px bg-border` separator, expanded mode uses `h-px bg-border my-2 mx-3`
  - The `onSyncClick` prop controls whether Import button is rendered

## 2026-01-14 - US-002.1: Collapsed sidebar left-side orange pill indicator
- What was implemented:
  - Modified the active indicator to show in both expanded AND collapsed modes
  - Changed from conditional rendering (`!isCollapsed &&`) to always rendering with mode-specific positioning
  - Removed the bottom dot indicator that was only shown in collapsed mode
  - Left-side pill in collapsed mode uses `left-0 h-[50%]`, expanded uses `left-1 h-[60%]`
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - updated active indicator logic
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Active indicator uses `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` for smooth scale-y transitions
  - The indicator scales from 0 to 100% on the Y axis when becoming active (`scale-y-0` to `scale-y-100`)
  - Use conditional CSS classes based on `isCollapsed` prop rather than conditional rendering when element should exist in both modes

## 2026-01-14 - US-003.1: Analytics appears before Settings in nav
- What was implemented:
  - Reordered `navItems` array to place Analytics before Settings
  - Settings is now the last nav item in the array
  - Keyboard navigation (ArrowDown/Up) automatically follows the new order (uses array index)
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - swapped Analytics and Settings position in navItems array
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Nav item order is controlled by the `navItems` array at the top of sidebar-nav.tsx (around line 144)
  - Keyboard navigation uses `focusNavItemByIndex` which iterates based on array order - no code changes needed when reordering
  - The array handles: id, name, iconLine, iconFill, path, and optional matchPaths
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-004.1: Settings at bottom of navigation
- What was implemented:
  - Verified Settings is already the last nav item (already done in US-003.1)
  - Settings appears after Analytics in the navItems array (index 6, after Analytics at index 5)
  - All Settings functionality unchanged (same path, icons, onSettingsClick callback)
  - No visual separation - Settings renders identically to other nav items in the map loop
- Files changed:
  - No code changes required - this was already completed by US-003.1
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-003.1 and US-004.1 are closely related - reordering Analytics before Settings automatically makes Settings the last item
  - Browser verification was blocked by pre-existing CSS parsing error in `src/index.css` (postcss/sucrase conflict) - this is an infrastructure issue unrelated to sidebar changes
  - The separator at line 400 (`{!isCollapsed && <div className="h-px bg-border my-2 mx-3" />}`) comes AFTER all nav items, before the Library Toggle - not between Settings and other nav items
