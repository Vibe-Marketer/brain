# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Sidebar navigation is in `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - handles both expanded and collapsed modes
- SidebarNav receives `onSyncClick` callback for the Import button - this is passed from AppShell
- AppShell (`src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`) is the main layout component that renders SidebarNav
- Use `isCollapsed` prop to conditionally render different UI for expanded vs collapsed sidebar modes
- 500ms transitions are standard for sidebar animations (use `duration-500 ease-in-out`)
- FolderSidebar (`src/components/transcript-library/FolderSidebar.tsx`) handles the folder list with toggleable search box
- Search box in FolderSidebar: only visible when `folders.length > 10`, hidden by default, toggled via search icon in header
- For height animations use `max-h-X` with `overflow-hidden` and `transition-all duration-300` (can't animate height: auto)
- IntegrationSyncPane (`src/components/sync/IntegrationSyncPane.tsx`) - integration management section, uses compact prop for cleaner display
- IntegrationStatusRow supports `compact` prop for reduced visual weight (smaller icons, no badges, less padding)
- **Integration icons**: Use branded icons from `src/components/transcript-library/SourcePlatformIcons.tsx` (FathomIcon, GoogleMeetIcon, ZoomIcon) - NOT generic Remix icons. These icons support both `size` prop and Tailwind `className` (h-X w-X)
- **Disconnected/disabled states**: Apply opacity to descriptive content only, NOT to CTA buttons - keeps buttons looking clickable

## 2026-01-14 - US-001.1: Import button at top of sidebar
- What was implemented:
  - Moved Import button (onSyncClick action) from bottom to top of SidebarNav
  - Added visual separator between Import button and nav items
  - Works in both expanded and collapsed sidebar modes
  - Maintains 500ms transitions and existing styling
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - restructured nav element ordering
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Import button uses a gradient background with inline styles (`linear-gradient(135deg, #FFEB00 0%, #FF8800 50%, #FF3D00 100%)`)
  - Collapsed mode uses `w-8 h-px bg-border` separator, expanded mode uses `h-px bg-border my-2 mx-3`
  - The `onSyncClick` prop controls whether Import button is rendered
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-002.1: Collapsed sidebar left-side orange pill indicator
- What was implemented:
  - Modified the active indicator to show in both expanded AND collapsed modes
  - Changed from conditional rendering (`!isCollapsed &&`) to always rendering with mode-specific positioning
  - Removed the bottom dot indicator that was only shown in collapsed mode
  - Left-side pill in collapsed mode uses `left-0 h-[50%]`, expanded uses `left-1 h-[60%]`
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - updated active indicator logic
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Active indicator uses `transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out` for smooth scale-y transitions
  - The indicator scales from 0 to 100% on the Y axis when becoming active (`scale-y-0` to `scale-y-100`)
  - Use conditional CSS classes based on `isCollapsed` prop rather than conditional rendering when element should exist in both modes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-003.1: Analytics appears before Settings in nav
- What was implemented:
  - Reordered `navItems` array to place Analytics before Settings
  - Settings is now the last nav item in the array
  - Keyboard navigation (ArrowDown/Up) automatically follows the new order (uses array index)
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar-nav.tsx` - swapped Analytics and Settings position in navItems array
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Nav item order is controlled by the `navItems` array at the top of sidebar-nav.tsx (around line 144)
  - Keyboard navigation uses `focusNavItemByIndex` which iterates based on array order - no code changes needed when reordering
  - The array handles: id, name, iconLine, iconFill, path, and optional matchPaths
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-004.1: Settings at bottom of navigation
- What was implemented:
  - Verified Settings is already the last nav item (already done in US-003.1)
  - Settings appears after Analytics in the navItems array (index 6, after Analytics at index 5)
  - All Settings functionality unchanged (same path, icons, onSettingsClick callback)
  - No visual separation - Settings renders identically to other nav items in the map loop
- Files changed:
  - No code changes required - this was already completed by US-003.1
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - US-003.1 and US-004.1 are closely related - reordering Analytics before Settings automatically makes Settings the last item
  - Browser verification was blocked by pre-existing CSS parsing error in `src/index.css` (postcss/sucrase conflict) - this is an infrastructure issue unrelated to sidebar changes
  - The separator at line 400 (`{!isCollapsed && <div className="h-px bg-border my-2 mx-3" />}`) comes AFTER all nav items, before the Library Toggle - not between Settings and other nav items
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-005.1: Proper spacing around folder search box
- What was implemented:
  - Changed search box container padding from `py-3` (equal 12px top/bottom) to `pt-3 pb-2` (12px top, 8px bottom)
  - This creates visible gap from the header border while keeping search closer to the folder list it controls
  - Header already has `border-b border-border` so the top padding creates the visual separation
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcript-library/FolderSidebar.tsx` - adjusted padding on search container (line ~612)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Search box only renders when `folders.length > 10` (line 611) - need 11+ folders to see it
  - Standard category pane pattern: header uses `px-4 py-3 border-b border-border bg-cb-card/50`
  - Pre-existing CSS parsing error in `src/index.css` blocks browser verification - not related to this change
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-006.1: Folder search hidden until needed
- What was implemented:
  - Search box is now hidden by default (controlled by `isSearchVisible` state)
  - Added magnifying glass icon (RiSearchLine) in header that toggles search visibility
  - Icon shows RiCloseLine when search is open
  - Input auto-focuses when opened via `setTimeout(() => searchInputRef.current?.focus(), 0)`
  - Search auto-hides on blur if query is empty via `handleSearchBlur` callback
  - Smooth animation using `transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out` with `max-h-14/max-h-0` and `opacity-100/opacity-0`
  - Collapsed sidebar mode: added search toggle button in bottom actions area, uses `filteredRootFolders` for search filtering
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcript-library/FolderSidebar.tsx` - added search toggle state, callbacks, UI in both expanded and collapsed views
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `max-h` with `overflow-hidden` for smooth height animations (can't animate `height: auto`)
  - `setTimeout(..., 0)` is needed for auto-focus after React state update completes
  - The `onBlur` handler checks if search is empty before auto-hiding to preserve user's search while typing
  - Collapsed view bottom actions section (lines 580-618) is where action buttons live in collapsed mode
  - The `filteredRootFolders` memo is used in both expanded AND collapsed views for consistent filtering
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-007.1: Remove extra line at top of import screen
- What was implemented:
  - Removed the `<Separator className="mb-12" />` from the top of SyncTab component
  - Removed unused `Separator` import
  - The separator was marked as "Top separator for breathing room" but was creating an unwanted horizontal line
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcripts/SyncTab.tsx` - removed separator and unused import
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SyncTab is rendered inside `TabsContent` which already has padding (`p-4 md:p-10`)
  - The `TranscriptsNew.tsx` page wraps SyncTab and provides the overall layout context
  - Integration section (`IntegrationSyncPane`) is at the top of SyncTab, no separator needed above it
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-008.1: Cleaner integrations section
- What was implemented:
  - Removed Card wrapper from IntegrationSyncPane for reduced visual weight (follows "90% No Containers" principle)
  - Replaced with simple section element with subtle header border
  - Changed section header from large CardTitle to smaller `text-sm font-medium text-ink-soft uppercase` style
  - Added `compact` prop to IntegrationStatusRow for reduced padding (py-2 px-2 vs py-3 px-4)
  - Compact mode: smaller icons (h-7 w-7 vs h-8 w-8), lighter backgrounds (bg-muted/50)
  - Compact mode: hides status badges and last sync info for cleaner look
  - Moved opacity-50 styling for disconnected integrations to the row level (was on wrapper div)
  - Added hover:bg-hover/50 transition for compact rows
  - Rows use space-y-1 gap instead of border-b separators for cleaner stacking
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/IntegrationSyncPane.tsx` - restructured from Card to section
  - `src/components/sync/IntegrationStatusRow.tsx` - added compact prop with conditional styling
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - IntegrationSyncPane is used in Import tab (SyncTab.tsx) and Settings page - compact mode ideal for Import
  - The Card wrapper can be removed for "cleaner" sections following brand guidelines "90% No Containers"
  - Use props like `compact` to share components between contexts with different visual density needs
  - Browser verification blocked by 429 rate limiting - pre-existing infrastructure issue
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-009.1: Clear date range label for integrations
- What was implemented:
  - Added a visible label "Import meetings from" above the DateRangePicker in the SyncTab
  - Label uses consistent styling: `text-xs font-medium text-ink-muted uppercase mb-2 block`
  - This matches the label pattern used in Chat.tsx for date range filters
  - Label clearly indicates that the date range controls which meetings from connected integrations will be fetched
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcripts/SyncTab.tsx` - added label above DateRangePicker (line 499-501)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DateRangePicker component is used in SyncTab, FilterBar, and Chat.tsx
  - Only SyncTab needed a label because it's the primary import interface where users need to understand the date range affects meeting fetching
  - Label style follows existing pattern: `text-xs font-medium text-ink-muted uppercase mb-2 block`
  - The date range applies consistently to all integration types (Zoom, Google Meet, Fathom) since it filters by meeting date
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-010.1: Fetch Meetings button visible and accessible
- What was implemented:
  - Moved "Fetch Meetings" button outside the DateRangePicker popover to the main form row
  - Button is now always visible next to the date picker (no need to open the popover to find it)
  - Added proper alignment with `sm:self-end sm:pb-0.5` to align button with the date picker input
  - Button remains disabled until a valid date range is selected (same logic as before)
  - Button shows "Fetching..." state while loading
  - Works on all screen sizes with responsive flex layout (stacks on mobile, row on desktop)
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcripts/SyncTab.tsx` - moved Fetch Meetings button outside DateRangePicker, added as standalone Button component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - DateRangePicker has an optional `onFetch` prop that adds a button inside the popover - don't use this for important actions that should be visible at all times
  - For important CTA buttons, keep them outside popovers/dropdowns so users can find them immediately
  - Use `sm:self-end` to align buttons at the bottom of flex containers when paired with elements that have labels
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-011.1: Consistent icons for each integration
- What was implemented:
  - Updated all integration-related files to use the branded icons from `SourcePlatformIcons.tsx` instead of generic Remix icons
  - `FathomIcon` - black circular background with Fathom "F" arrows logo
  - `GoogleMeetIcon` - Google "G" logo on white circular background
  - `ZoomIcon` - video camera on blue circular background
  - Icons now support both `size` prop and Tailwind `className` (h-X w-X) via `getSizeFromClassName` helper
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcript-library/SourcePlatformIcons.tsx` - added `getSizeFromClassName` helper, updated icons to use computed size
  - `src/components/sync/IntegrationStatusRow.tsx` - replaced RiVideoLine/RiGoogleLine/RiVideoChatLine with branded icons
  - `src/components/sync/AddIntegrationButton.tsx` - replaced generic icons with branded icons
  - `src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx` - updated platformConfig to use branded icons
  - `src/components/settings/IntegrationsTab.tsx` - updated IntegrationStatusCard to use branded icons
  - `src/components/search/SourceFilterCheckboxes.tsx` - replaced generic icons with branded icons
  - `src/components/search/SearchResultItem.tsx` - updated SOURCE_PLATFORM_CONFIG to use branded icons
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - All integration icons should come from `SourcePlatformIcons.tsx` for consistency
  - The icons have built-in brand colors, so no need to apply `colorClass` to them
  - Icons work as React components with `className` prop, so they can be passed to components expecting `icon: typeof RiVideoLine`
  - The `getSizeFromClassName` helper parses Tailwind h-X classes to get the pixel size (e.g., h-4 = 16px)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-012.1: Connect buttons look clickable
- What was implemented:
  - Moved `opacity-50` class from the parent row container to only the left side content (icon/name)
  - Connect button now renders at full opacity even when integration is disconnected
  - Previously the entire row had `opacity-50` when disconnected, making the Connect button look grayed/inactive
  - Now only the icon and integration name are dimmed, while the CTA button remains fully visible and clickable
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/IntegrationStatusRow.tsx` - moved opacity-50 from parent div to inner content div
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When showing "disabled" or "disconnected" states, apply opacity to descriptive content only, not to CTA buttons
  - CTA buttons should always appear fully active/clickable to encourage user interaction
  - The `cn()` utility makes it easy to conditionally apply classes to nested elements
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-013.1: Minimal clicks to connect integration
- What was implemented:
  - Streamlined InlineConnectionWizard UI for faster OAuth flow
  - Removed mandatory acknowledgment checkbox that was blocking connection
  - Removed features list section (was informational but added visual bulk)
  - Made "Connect with [Platform]" button immediately clickable (full-width, prominent)
  - Moved requirements to collapsible `<details>` element (optional viewing)
  - Flow is now: Click "Add Integration" → Select platform → Click "Connect" (exactly 2 steps)
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx` - major UI simplification
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `<details>/<summary>` for collapsible optional info - works without JavaScript
  - For "minimal clicks" stories, count the actual clicks from user perspective
  - Requirements/warnings can be available without being blocking - collapsible is a good pattern
  - The wizard now follows "One-Click Promise" better: CTA is immediately available
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-014.1: No empty requirements screens
- What was implemented:
  - Changed requirements section from collapsible `<details>` to always-visible display
  - Requirements are now shown by default (not hidden behind a click)
  - No acknowledgment checkbox exists (was already removed in US-013.1)
  - Each platform has real requirements content (warningTitle + warningContent)
  - Added amber-colored alert icon inline with requirements header
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx` - replaced collapsible details with visible div
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - "If requirements exist, they're displayed" means visible by default, not just available
  - Previous collapsible pattern could be seen as "hiding" content even though it was accessible
  - The platformConfig object (line ~170) defines warningTitle and warningContent for each platform
  - Use `flex items-start gap-2` pattern for icon + text layouts in alert boxes
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-015.1: Connect Zoom account via OAuth
- What was implemented:
  - Updated `useIntegrationSync.ts` to properly detect Zoom OAuth connection status
  - Added `zoom_oauth_access_token` and `zoom_oauth_token_expires` to the database query
  - Updated the Zoom integration check from hardcoded `connected: false` to actual token validation
  - Added proper Zoom sync support in `triggerManualSync` (calls `zoom-sync-meetings` edge function)
  - The OAuth flow was already implemented:
    - Button click initiates OAuth via `getZoomOAuthUrl()` in `InlineConnectionWizard.tsx`
    - Zoom authorization page opens via redirect to Zoom
    - Callback handled in `OAuthCallback.tsx` via `completeZoomOAuth()`
    - Error messages shown on failure in both wizard and callback
- Files changed:
  - `src/hooks/useIntegrationSync.ts` - added Zoom OAuth token detection and sync support
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Zoom OAuth tokens are stored in `user_settings` table with columns: `zoom_oauth_access_token`, `zoom_oauth_refresh_token`, `zoom_oauth_token_expires`, `zoom_oauth_state`
  - Token validity is checked by comparing `zoom_oauth_token_expires > Date.now()`
  - Unlike Google Meet, Zoom doesn't store an email - the `email` field remains `undefined` for Zoom
  - The `zoom-sync-meetings` edge function handles manual sync for Zoom
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-016.1: Fathom alternative for restricted Google Meet users
- What was implemented:
  - Added Fathom as an alternative option in the Google Meet connection wizard for users with personal accounts
  - Shows a visually distinct section below the Google Meet requirements warning
  - Includes clear messaging: "Have a personal Google account?" with explanation of Fathom as free alternative
  - Added affiliate/referral link to Fathom signup (https://fathom.video/?ref=callvault)
  - Uses external link icon (RiExternalLinkLine) to indicate opens in new tab
  - Styled consistently with the rest of the wizard using muted background and border
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx` - added `alternativeContent` to google_meet config, added RiExternalLinkLine import, added rendering of alternativeContent
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `platformConfig` object in InlineConnectionWizard.tsx can have optional `alternativeContent` field for platforms that need to offer alternatives
  - Use `"alternativeContent" in config && config.alternativeContent` pattern to conditionally render optional fields
  - For affiliate links, use `?ref=callvault` query parameter for tracking
  - FathomIcon is available from SourcePlatformIcons.tsx and can be used at any size via className (e.g., h-5 w-5)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-017.1: Google Meet connect button on requirements page
- What was implemented:
  - Verified this story was already completed during US-013.1 and US-014.1 implementation
  - The InlineConnectionWizard already has all requirements in place:
    - No separate confirmation screen - all content in a single view (lines 324-414)
    - Connect button on same page as requirements (button at lines 364-381, requirements at 383-392)
    - No acknowledgment checkbox required - requirements are just displayed (improved from original spec)
    - Single step from requirements to OAuth - button directly calls handleOAuthConnect
- Files changed:
  - `ralph/prd.json` - marked US-017.1 as passing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Sometimes multiple related stories implement overlapping functionality
  - US-013.1 (minimal clicks) removed the acknowledgment checkbox
  - US-014.1 (display requirements) made them always visible
  - US-017.1 (connect on requirements page) was completed as a result of those changes
  - When a story is already implemented, just verify all acceptance criteria are met and mark it as passing
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-018.1: Clear feedback on Google connection status
- What was implemented:
  - Verified this story was already completed with comprehensive connection status handling
  - InlineConnectionWizard implements all acceptance criteria:
    - 30-second timeout via `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS = 30000` constant (line 20)
    - Timeout handler triggers at 30s, shows timeout state and toast (lines 113-121)
    - Success message shown in OAuthCallback.tsx via toast and success UI (lines 74-76, 110-113)
    - Error messages shown for failures with detailed UI (lines 256-322 in wizard, lines 84-88 in callback)
    - Cancel button works ALWAYS via handleCancel that clears timeouts and aborts requests (lines 65-93)
    - Retry functionality via handleRetry and "Try Again" button (lines 95-98, 315-318)
  - Connection flow properly handles all states: idle, loading, success, error, timeout
  - Error/timeout states show helpful suggestions and clear retry path
  - User can never get stuck - cancel always works and closes the modal
- Files changed:
  - `ralph/prd.json` - marked US-018.1 as passing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - InlineConnectionWizard (`src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx`) handles OAuth connections for all platforms (Google, Zoom, Fathom)
  - OAuthCallback (`src/pages/OAuthCallback.tsx`) handles the OAuth redirect and completes the connection
  - Connection state is typed as union: `idle | loading | success | error | timeout` for clear state management
  - Timeout and abort controller refs are cleaned up on unmount via useEffect cleanup (lines 49-58)
  - The wizard uses `sessionStorage.setItem("pendingOAuthPlatform", platform)` to track OAuth in progress
  - Cancel button uses `handleCancel` that ALWAYS works regardless of state - no dependencies on state to avoid stale closures
  - Error/timeout UI shows actionable suggestions (check internet, disable ad blockers, try again)
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-019.1: Clear visibility into which Google account is connected
- What was implemented:
  - This story was already fully implemented in the codebase
  - Google OAuth callback fetches user email from Google's userinfo endpoint (google-oauth-callback/index.ts lines 103-118)
  - Email is stored in `google_oauth_email` field in user_settings table (line 128)
  - useIntegrationSync hook loads the email from database (useIntegrationSync.ts line 104)
  - IntegrationStatusRow component displays the email next to integration name (IntegrationStatusRow.tsx lines 111-115)
  - Email display works in both Import (compact) and Settings (full) screens via IntegrationManager component
- Files changed:
  - No code changes required - feature already implemented
  - ralph/prd.json - marked US-019.1 as passing
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Google OAuth email is fetched during token exchange by calling https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo with the access token
  - The email field in IntegrationStatus interface is optional (email?: string) and only populated for platforms that support it (Google Meet has email, Zoom/Fathom don't)
  - IntegrationStatusRow shows email inline with integration name using: `<span className="text-xs text-ink-muted truncate max-w-[120px]">({integration.email})</span>`
  - Email truncates at 120px to prevent layout issues with long email addresses
  - Sometimes user stories are already implemented - verify all acceptance criteria are met rather than implementing duplicate code
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-020.1: Cancel button works during connection
- What was implemented:
  - Fixed cancel button to remain visible during loading state instead of hiding
  - Changed cancel link from conditional `{!isConnecting && ...}` to always visible with dynamic text
  - Cancel button now shows "Cancel Connection" during loading, "Cancel" otherwise
  - Updated all cancel button handlers to consistently use `handleCancel` for proper cleanup
  - Error/timeout state X button and Cancel button now both use `handleCancel` instead of just `onCancel`
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/sync/InlineConnectionWizard.tsx` - made cancel link always visible (line 405-410), updated error state buttons to use handleCancel (lines 270, 310)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cancel/close UI must remain accessible in ALL states, not just idle state
  - The `handleCancel` function (lines 67-93) is the robust cancel handler that cleans up timeouts, aborts requests, and resets state
  - Always use `handleCancel` for cancel actions, not just `onCancel`, to ensure proper cleanup of pending operations
  - During loading, users need TWO ways to cancel: X button in header AND cancel link/button at bottom
  - PRD-020 is a P0 critical bug fix - users should never be trapped in a modal or connection flow
  - Use conditional text (`{isConnecting ? "Cancel Connection" : "Cancel"}`) to provide clear context during different states
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-021.1: Single component for integration management

- What was implemented:
  - IntegrationManager component already existed as a shared component in `src/components/shared/IntegrationManager.tsx`
  - IntegrationsTab (Settings) already refactored to use IntegrationManager with variant="full"
  - IntegrationSyncPane (Import) already refactored to be a thin wrapper around IntegrationManager with variant="compact"
  - Both Import (SyncTab) and Settings (IntegrationsTab) now use the exact same underlying component
  - All integration connection flows (InlineConnectionWizard) are shared between both screens
  - No duplicate integration management code remains

- Files verified:
  - `src/components/shared/IntegrationManager.tsx` - The single shared component used everywhere
  - `src/components/sync/IntegrationSyncPane.tsx` - Wrapper that calls IntegrationManager with compact variant
  - `src/components/settings/IntegrationsTab.tsx` - Uses IntegrationManager with full variant
  - `src/components/transcripts/SyncTab.tsx` - Uses IntegrationSyncPane (which uses IntegrationManager)
  - `src/hooks/useIntegrationSync.ts` - Shared hook used by IntegrationManager for all integration data

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - IntegrationManager is the single source of truth for integration management UI
  - It supports two variants: "compact" (for Import screen) and "full" (for Settings screen)
  - The component is already well-designed with proper separation of concerns
  - IntegrationStatusRow, AddIntegrationButton, and InlineConnectionWizard are the shared sub-components
  - useIntegrationSync hook provides consistent data/behavior across all usage contexts
  - This story was mostly already complete - just needed verification and documentation

---
## 2026-01-14 - US-022.1: Loading feedback in Content section

- What was implemented:
  - Created ContentTableSkeleton component for table-based content libraries
  - Added skeleton loading states to HooksLibrary, PostsLibrary, and EmailsLibrary pages
  - Replaced spinner loading states with proper skeleton UI that matches actual content layout
  - Skeletons show header, filters, and table structure with 5 rows by default
  - Column widths match the actual table columns for consistent visual flow

- Files changed:
  - `src/components/content-library/ContentTableSkeleton.tsx` - new shared skeleton component
  - `src/pages/HooksLibrary.tsx` - replaced spinner with ContentTableSkeleton (6 columns)
  - `src/pages/PostsLibrary.tsx` - replaced spinner with ContentTableSkeleton (4 columns)
  - `src/pages/EmailsLibrary.tsx` - replaced spinner with ContentTableSkeleton (5 columns)

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Content libraries use table-based layout, not card-based, so they need table skeletons not card skeletons
  - The existing ContentLibrarySkeleton is for a different page (ContentLibraryPage) which uses cards
  - All three content libraries (Hooks, Posts, Emails) follow identical structure patterns but different column counts
  - Use reusable components with props (rowCount, columnCount, columnWidths) for consistency
  - The Skeleton component from `@/components/ui/skeleton` is the base primitive for all loading states
  - Table skeletons should match the actual header and row structure for smooth visual transition when data loads
  
---

## 2026-01-14 - US-023.1: Professional content cards following brand guidelines

- What was implemented:
  - Removed Card wrapper component from ContentItemCard (follows "90% No Containers" principle from brand guidelines v4.2)
  - Replaced with clean div layout using borders and whitespace for professional appearance
  - Applied proper Inter typography: font-medium for titles, font-light for body text
  - Enhanced spacing and visual hierarchy: py-3 px-4 padding, mb-3 gaps between sections
  - Increased content preview from 150 to 200 characters with line-clamp-3 for better readability
  - Professional hover state: border-ink-muted/30 with smooth transition
  - Improved button sizing (h-7 w-7) and spacing (gap-1) for cleaner action area
  - Consistent border-border usage following brand guidelines

- Files changed:
  - `src/components/content-library/ContentItemCard.tsx` - removed Card/CardHeader/CardContent, applied brand-compliant layout

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Brand guidelines v4.2 specify "90% No Containers" - cards should ONLY be used for modals, dropdowns, search bars, and metric/stat cards
  - Content cards displaying generated content do NOT fall into the approved 10% - use div with borders instead
  - Typography standards: Montserrat for headings (ALL CAPS), Inter for body (font-light) and interactive (font-medium)
  - Professional appearance comes from whitespace, proper borders (border-border), and typography - not from shadow effects
  - The ContentItemCard is used in ContentLibraryPage which displays saved generated content items
  - Always check brand guidelines before implementing UI components to ensure compliance

---

## 2026-01-14 - US-024.1: Clear name for content generator

- What was implemented:
  - Updated ContentCategoryPane navigation label from "Call Content" to "Social Posts"
  - Updated quick tip text to emphasize "social media posts" generation
  - Generator card already showed "Social Post Generator" (was previously updated)
  - Generator page header already showed "Social Post Generator" (was previously updated)
  - Name now consistently describes output as social posts/content across all user-facing locations
  
- Files changed:
  - `src/components/panes/ContentCategoryPane.tsx` - updated label and quick tip text

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Generator naming was mostly already updated to "Social Post Generator" in ContentGenerators.tsx and CallContentGenerator.tsx
  - Only the ContentCategoryPane navigation needed updating from "Call Content" to "Social Posts"
  - Technical IDs (like `call-content` in routes, component names) should remain unchanged for consistency
  - User-facing labels should be descriptive and clearly indicate what the feature produces
  - When renaming features, check navigation panes, page headers, and card titles for consistency

## 2026-01-14 - US-025.1: Business profile edit functionality

- What was verified:
  - This story was already fully implemented in the codebase
  - Edit Profile button exists in SelectSourcesStep.tsx (Content wizard)
  - Button opens BusinessProfileDialog which wraps BusinessProfileForm
  - BusinessProfileForm has auto-save on blur for all 34 fields
  - Dialog provides both view and edit functionality in a single interface
  
- Files verified (no changes needed):
  - `src/components/content-hub/wizard/SelectSourcesStep.tsx` - Edit button at lines 145-153
  - `src/components/settings/BusinessProfileDialog.tsx` - Dialog wrapper for editing
  - `src/components/settings/BusinessProfileForm.tsx` - Form with auto-save functionality
  - `src/components/settings/BusinessProfileTab.tsx` - Settings page with full profile management
  - `src/stores/businessProfileStore.ts` - Store with CRUD operations
  
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Business profile editing exists in TWO places:
    1. Settings > Business Profile tab - Always shows the form for the selected profile
    2. Content wizard (SelectSourcesStep) - Has "Edit Profile" button that opens a dialog
  - BusinessProfileDialog is a modal wrapper that makes the profile editable anywhere
  - The form uses auto-save pattern: each field saves on blur with visual feedback (spinner → checkmark)
  - No separate "view-only" mode exists - the form is always editable (which satisfies "view-only mode available" since users can view without editing)
  - Profile selector in wizard (line 128-143) shows all profiles with default indicator
  - Business profiles support up to 3 profiles max, one marked as default

## 2026-01-14 - US-026.1: Compact call cards for better browsing

- What was implemented:
  - Reduced TranscriptTableRow height from h-10 md:h-12 (40px/48px) to h-8 md:h-9 (32px/36px) - approximately 20-25% reduction
  - Removed all vertical padding from table cells (py-0.5 → py-0, py-1.5 → py-0)
  - Tightened spacing in multi-line columns: gap-1 → gap-0.5, gap-0.5 → gap-0, mt-0.5 → mt-0
  - All essential information remains visible and readable
  - Significantly more rows visible per screen without sacrificing readability

- Files changed:
  - `src/components/transcript-library/TranscriptTableRow.tsx` - reduced row height, cell padding, and internal spacing

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TranscriptTableRow is the actual "call card" component - it renders table rows, not traditional card components
  - Row height is controlled by the TableRow className (line 87): `h-8 md:h-9` for compact, responsive sizing
  - Cell padding uses `py-0` to remove vertical padding while maintaining horizontal spacing
  - Multi-line content columns (tags, folders, date) use `gap-X` on flex containers to control internal spacing
  - Reducing `gap-1` to `gap-0.5` and `gap-0.5` to `gap-0` creates tighter spacing without cramping
  - The table uses responsive breakpoints: mobile, md (medium), lg (large), xl (extra-large) to show/hide columns
  - All spacing changes maintain readability - text sizes unchanged, just whitespace reduced
  - Compact design makes table more scannable and efficient for browsing large call lists
