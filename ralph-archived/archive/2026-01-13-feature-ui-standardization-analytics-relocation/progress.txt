# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- Pane headers use `py-3` for 48px height (12px top + ~24px content + 12px bottom)
- Header pattern: `flex items-center gap-3 px-4 py-3 border-b border-cb-border bg-cb-card/50`
- Icon containers: `w-8 h-8 rounded-lg bg-cb-vibe-orange/10` with `text-cb-vibe-orange`
- Pre-existing lint errors exist in `.kilocode/worktrees` directories - these are separate worktrees and don't block builds

## 2026-01-13 - US-001: Update SettingsCategoryPane header py-4 to py-3
- Changed `py-4` to `py-3` in header class on line 232 of SettingsCategoryPane.tsx
- Files changed: `src/components/panes/SettingsCategoryPane.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The 48px header height is achieved with `py-3` (12px padding) + content (~24px with icon/text)
  - SettingsCategoryPane is the reference implementation for category pane headers
  - Build passes despite lint errors in worktree directories (these are pre-existing)

## 2026-01-13 - US-002: Update SortingCategoryPane header py-4 to py-3
- Changed `py-4` to `py-3` in header class on line 182 of SortingCategoryPane.tsx
- Files changed: `src/components/panes/SortingCategoryPane.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SortingCategoryPane follows the same header pattern as SettingsCategoryPane
  - The header is at line ~182 with class `flex items-center gap-3 px-4 py-3 border-b border-cb-border bg-cb-card/50`
  - This pane also has a "Quick Tips" section at the bottom that other panes may not have

## 2026-01-13 - US-003: Standardize FolderSidebar header to match Settings/Sorting pattern
- Replaced custom header in FolderSidebar.tsx (lines ~589-611) with standardized pattern
- Added icon container with `w-8 h-8 rounded-lg bg-cb-vibe-orange/10` and `RiFolderLine` icon
- Changed title from "Folders" to "Library" with proper styling: `text-sm font-semibold text-cb-ink uppercase tracking-wide`
- Added dynamic subtitle: `{folders.length} {folders.length === 1 ? 'folder' : 'folders'}`
- Kept + button on right side with `flex-shrink-0` to prevent layout issues
- Changed outer div to `<header>` semantic element with proper classes: `flex items-center gap-3 px-4 py-3 border-b border-cb-border bg-cb-card/50`
- Files changed: `src/components/transcript-library/FolderSidebar.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FolderSidebar has both collapsed and expanded views - only expanded view has the header (collapsed shows icon-only navigation)
  - The header now matches the exact pattern from SettingsCategoryPane.tsx (lines 232-250)
  - Added `id="folder-sidebar-title"` for accessibility labeling (aria-labelledby can reference this)
  - Use `flex-1` on the title container and `flex-shrink-0` on buttons to ensure proper layout
