# SPEC-023: Content Cards Visual Design

**Status:** Ready for PRD
**Created:** 2026-01-14
**Category:** Content Section
**Priority:** UI Enhancement (Low - Future)

---

## Summary

Redesign content cards to have a more polished, professional look rather than the current generic "vibe code AI" aesthetic.

## What

Visual redesign of content/post cards in the Content section.

**Files to investigate:**
- Content card components
- `src/components/content/` directory

**Current:** Cards have generic, auto-generated feel - "cheap/AI-generated" vibe
**Done:** Professional, polished card design aligned with brand guidelines

## Why

- Current cards don't reflect brand quality
- Generic look undermines trust
- Cards are primary content display - need to look good
- Design differentiation from competitors

## User Experience

- User sees polished, professional content cards
- Cards feel intentionally designed, not auto-generated
- Visual appeal matches rest of application

## Scope

**Includes:**
- Card layout redesign
- Typography improvements
- Visual hierarchy
- Consistent with brand guidelines v4.2

**Excludes:**
- Card functionality changes
- Content type changes

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Cards align with brand guidelines
- [ ] Professional, non-generic appearance
- [ ] Good typography and spacing
- [ ] Consistent visual language

## User Story

**As a** CallVault user
**I want** content cards to look professional
**So that** I trust the quality of generated content

## Notes

This is noted as "can be addressed later" in repair list - lower priority than functional fixes.
